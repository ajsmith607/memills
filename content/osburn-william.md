William Osburn was born on March 11, 1906, the son of Walter Grant Osburn, and has been a lifelong resident of Speedsville. He retired from National Cash Register in 1971. He, like his father, grandfather and uncles, is a very good carpenter. Besides being an excellent gardener and "history collector", he is fondly known by all the residents of Speedsville as the unofficial "town historian". He has written many articles for the DeWitt Historical Society and the book The Hills of Caroline.

William Osburn of Speedsville describes the labor involved in the building of shelters in his paper "Pioneers Worked With Simple Tools." [Chapter in Forest To Farms]

The 4th of July was usually celebrated with Old Home Days, parades or other activities. William Osburn wrote an article entitled "Speedsville's 4th of July Celebration...Noisy":
