Inheritance Planning: Older parents may choose to transfer assets, such as a home, to their children as a way to simplify their estate and potentially reduce inheritance taxes. By transferring ownership of the home to their children while they are still alive, parents can ensure that the property passes directly to their children upon their death, avoiding the probate process.

Financial Support: In cases where the younger children may not have the financial means to purchase a home outright, parents may provide financial assistance or gifts to help them with the purchase. This can be seen as an investment in the younger generation's future and a way to support them in achieving homeownership.

> Bates, Abram, was born in Hartford, Conn., August 28, 1810. He is a son of Selick Bates, who was also a native of Connecticut, but moved to Danby, N. Y., in 1812, where he resided until his death in 1836. He had nine children, of whom Abram was the fifth. Their names are: Elizabeth, Sally A., Hannah, Hezekiah, Abram, Isaac, Fannie and Charles. All are now deceased except Abram, Hannah and Hezekiah. Charles was killed when only twenty-one years of age; his team ran away and threw him from his wagon. Abram resided with his father until eighteen years of age, then went to learn blacksmithing. For nine months he was with R. L. Cowdiy. For a time after this he worked nights and mornings with William Sanford and went to school during the day. Finally after working with various men, he returned to Danby, where he opened a shop of his own. He was successful and the second year hired a farm, and operated his shop and farm at the same time for five years. He next bought a farm on Ithaca Hill, moved on to it in 1836, and cultivated it for six years. In 1842 he bought the farm in Caroline upon which he still lives. He married Mary E., daughter of Charles Wright, on November 1, 1832. They had nine children: Charles W., Mary J., Francis A., Sarah A., Frederick E., Caroline A., Martin L., Kate E. and Theron A. Charles W., Martin L. and Theron A. died unmarried. Abram Bates received a common school education, but his children had the benefit of high school and academy. Our subject is a large owner of real estate in New York and Pennsylvania. He is also a large owner in the Ithaca Hotel, and has other property in the city. He takes a great interest in politics, but has always declined to hold office.

> Six Mile Creek rises in Dryden, flows southwest through Slaterville and Brookton, thence northwest through Ithaca, uniting with the Inlet at the foot of State street. The only considerable waterfall upon it is known as Wells Falls, situated inside the city limits, but the valley of the stream above abounds with deep gorges and wild, impressive scenery.

> The building of the early mills at this point determined its locality as a site for a village. The Upper Grist Mill, as it has been known, stands nearly opposite the site of the old Cantine Mill, which was built about the year 1800, and was burned in 1862, while owned by Joseph Chambers. The present mill was built by George White in 1865, and was sold by him to F. C. Cornell. This mill is not now running. It was at one time owned by William Mott 2d, as was also the mill on the present Voorhis site several years previous. The latter mill was destroyed by fire and rebuilt by David C. Roe in 1850. It passed through several hands to the Voorhises, father and sons, and was burnt in 1890 or 91. Fred E. Bates then became proprietor of the site and built thereon the present mill, and very soon after resold it to the Voorhis brothers. Daniel M. White and Fred E. Bates have two saw mills here.

> Wolcott, George, jr., was born in Caroline, January 13, 1836. He is the son of George Wolcott, sr., a descendant of the purest Anglo-Saxon English. The father moved into this country when quite young, locating at Mott's Corners, now Brookton. He was a carpenter by trade, and held many local offices, being justice of the peace and school trustee for many terms. The mother of the subject of our sketch was Sarah A. Reede, a Scotchwoman. George and Sarah had ten children, of which George, jr., is the sixth. He acquired his education by his own efforts, paying his way at first at the old Ithaca Academy by working at the carpenter trade with his father, and later by teaching school. At Lincoln's first call for troops, on April 20, 1861, he enlisted as private in Company I of the afterward famous 32d N. Y. Infantry. At the battle of West Point he was promoted on the field from sergeant to second lieutenant by Colonel Mathewson, and after the seven days battle was again promoted to first lieutenant. At the end of his term of enlistment failing health compelled him to relinquish his very bright prospects in a military career. Returning to Caroline he followed the mercantile business, and afterwards that of carpenter and builder. About fifteen years ago he bought a farm and has since been principally engaged in farming. His wife, Julia A., whom he married in 1863, is the daughter of Hon. Peter Lounsbery, a descendant of the original German colonists, and Harriet Cantine, a descendant of the French Huguenots, a collateral relative of the Counts Cantine of France. They have one child, Clarence R., a lawyer of Ithaca. He, after acquiring a thorough education by the assistance of his father, took up the business of stenography, but only used it as a stepping stone to something better. He studied in the office of the Hon. S. D. Halliday, of Ithaca, and has been in active and successful practice for four years. Mrs. Wolcott is a poetess of considerable reputation, having taken prizes against many contestants, and having published prose and poetry in many periodicals. All the family are connected with the Congregational church at Brookton, of which Mr. Wolcott has been clerk and treasurer for years. He has also been school trustee many terms. He is an active member of the G. A. R., having been commander of David Ireland Post two years.

> Vorhis, F. C., was born in Spencer, Tioga county, August 24, 1861. Andrew C, his father, was a native of Spencer also, where he followed farming until 1877, at which; time he bought the old grist mill at Brookton, and was in partnership with his brother for two years, then from 1879 to 1887 he was sole proprietor. After this he was succeeded by his two sons, the business being conducted under the firm name of Vorhis Brothers. This continued till April 1, 1893. The old mill burning down January 28, 1889, they sold the water dam to Frederick Bates, and he built the new mill now standing on the old site. The firm was afterwards Bates, Vorhis & Company for a year then the Vorhis boys in 1890 bought out Mr. Bates's interest, and since 1893 our subject has conducted the business himself, buying out his brother. The capacity of the mill is fifty barrels of flour each day, fifty barrels of buckwheat in the same time. They will run another mill in connection soon. Mr. Vorhis is a member of the Congregational church, and in politics he is Democratic.

I have not been able to find an account of the 28 Jan 1889 fire. However, assuming this date is accurate, then there are some rather intriguing, but presumably only coincidental, connections to an "Ithaca fire bug" 

At that time, [Joan C. Vorhis](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/21978499/joan-c-vorhis) (07 Mar 1831 to 08 Dec 1905) was the widow of [William Randolph Vorhis](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/21978505/william_r_vorhis) (05 Oct 1832 to 24 Feb 1887), a brother of Andew Cameron Vorhis, whose sons were then running the lower grist mill. (Andrew and William's parents are
[Jotham William Vorhis](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/21978500/jotham_vorhis) (1785 to 18 Oct 1872) and [Elizabeth "Betsey" (Barker)](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/21978491/betsey_vorhis) (1795 to 1878))

At the time of the fires, [Frederick A.B. Ridgway](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/44450354/frederick-a_b-ridgway?_gl=1*47el1b*_gcl_au*MTQ4MTEyODAyMS4xNzA3MzU3OTU0) was described in the Ithaca Journal under news from Caroline Depot and was said to be "of White Church", and so, not far from the Vorhis Mill. F.A.B. Ridgway was a lawyer, and so he presumably knew both Horace Humiston Jr. and E.D. Shurter professionally at the very least.

F.A.B. had *two* sons named Frederick. [Frederick Ridgway](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/44450710/frederick_ridgway) (1869 to 22 Sep 1874) died at the age of five years, six months. (23 Sep 1874, Ithaca Journal, Ithaca, NY, p4), and it is noted in his entry on findagrave.com: "No headstone was located. Burial plot is between access road and Parker family plot." [Frederick "Fred" Ridgway](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/43913493/frederick_ridgway) (? to 28 Dec 1914) is described as an "invalid" () and his Pennsylvania death certificate states he had epilepsey. Fred lived in the care of his sister, [Dr. Mary Davis Ridgway](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/44450833/mary_davis_ridgway) (23 Nov 1873 to 04 Feb 1927), a noted Philadelphia surgeon and the founder of Providence General Hospital, a private sanitarium. Dr. Ridgway's mother, [Mary F. (Davis) Ridgway))](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/44450465/mary_f_ridgway) (09 Feb 1840 to 24 Nov 1908) was born in Philadelphia, the daughter of [Nailor C. Davis](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/43925761/nailor_c_davis) (24 Jan 1807 to 06 Mar 1863) a chief engineer in the United States Navy, who died "from injuries received on U.S. Monitor" (11 Mar 1864, Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p2).

Dr. Mary Davis Ridgway was "the fifteen year old daughter of Fred Ridgeway" assaulted by Abram Dennis (31 Jan 1889, Ithaca Daily Journal, Ithaca, NY, p3, q34). 

(The Ridgway name can also be found commonly spelled as "Ridgeway" in news articles, census entries, and elsewhere, but it appears the family preferred the shorter version.)

Dr. Mary Davis Ridgway is the aunt of [Dr. Mary Davis (Ridgway) Tinker](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/99049237/mary-davis-tinker) (24 Oct 1908 to 05 Nov 2014). "Dr. Mary" Tinker is remembered very affectionately by many in Caroline as I write this. Dr. Mary was born in 1908, exactly a month before the death of her grandmother Mary, and in the same year that [Dr. Benjamin Franklin Lockwood](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/97943230/benjamin-franklin-lockwood) (01 Mar 1862 to 15 May 1934) came to Brookton. Dr. Mary took over Dr. Lockwood's practice after his death. 

The reference to "Humiston" is Horace N. Humiston Jr., the son of Reverend Horace N. Humiston Sr., a former owner of Mills' Home in Brooktondale. 


Ester Charlotte (1836 to 1917) was AC vorhis's 2nd wife.

His first wife was Maryett (1823 to 1858)

mill names:

Personius Flouring Mills
F.C. & E.F. Vorhis or Vorhis Brothers
Bates, Vorhis & Company 
The Vorhis Milling Co.


"A barn at Brookton belonging to Elder Huff, a colored preacher, formerly of this place, was burned by an incendiary last week."

(06 Feb 1889, Ithaca Daily Journal, Ithaca, NY, p3, q31).


Finally, while all these events were taking place, Edward Mills, in his capacity as Brookton Postmaster, was involved in the Foote Case.

> Vandemarks, Benjamin, was born in the town of Caroline, November 15, 1830. James M., his father, a native of Ulster county, moved to Tompkins county when quite small, and always followed farming, owning a farm near Brookton. He married Rachael Personious of the town of Caroline, and they had eight children, our subject being the second, and now sixty-three years old. The latter has followed farming from early life, working at home with his father until his marriage in 1863 to Charlotte, daughter of Peter Dennis of the town of Caroline. They are the parents of five children, all at home but one. All were educated in the common schools except one, who graduated from the Ithaca High School, viz., Charles. In politics our subject is a Democrat.

> Krum, Henry S., was born in the town of Caroline, March 12, 1839. He was the oldest of six children, and always remained at home with his parents until his marriage, at which time he moved to his present farm, which is located on the road from Slaterville Springs to Brookton and consists of sixty acres of fine farming land, for which he paid in 1860, $6,000 in cash. In 1865 he married Mrs. Martha A. Landon, a widow, with one child, four years of age. They have never had any children. Mrs. Krum's daughter is now a teacher in Ithaca. Our subject is a Democrat in politics, and cast his first vote for Stephen A. Douglass. He has been commissioner of highways for three terms in succession. He is a Mason of Caroline Lodge No 681.
