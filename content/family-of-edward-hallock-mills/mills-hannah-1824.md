Hannah (Thatcher) Eastman Mills, born 21 May 1824, Hawkhurst, Kent, England, died 25 Feb 1917, Brookton NY. Second wife of Edward Hallock Mills, married 30 Dec 1896 and step-mother to Emily. Active member of Brookton Congregational Church, Ladies' Aid Society and Women's Christian Temperance Union. In this section, the Thatcher and Eastman genealogies are also explored.

<blockquote>
<p>"Mrs. Mills was one of Brookton’s oldest and most respected citizens and a remarkable woman. She enjoyed very good health, and had all her faculties up to the last. She was a great reader, and kept herself posted on all the current events and liked to converse upon them."
</p>
<p> "She was the recipient of many tokens of love and respect, some from distant states."

Hannah immigrated with her parents and siblings from the "Parish of Hawkhurst in the county of Kent, England", arriving in New York City on 28 Jul 1830. Like Ellen Gould, Hannah may have retained an English accent.

Hannah's first marriage was to [Charles Eastman](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/99264784/charles-c-eastman) (05 Aug 1807 to 22 May 1890), a prominent farmer in Danby. This was Charles' second marriage after the death of his first wife, and the mother of all of his children, [Polly (Coy) Eastman](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/99264890/polly-eastman) (14 Feb 1808 to 03 Dec 1862).

The 1896 New York State Marriage Index also traces Hannah back to her maiden name, with the identfication number 25877:

Edward and Hannah joined the church just weeks before their wedding:

My impressions of Hannah are that she was an active and outgoing woman who was much loved in the community.

{{% fig "1914-01-17-ithaca-journal" "500" /%}}

Hannah's visit with Reverend Bogardus is her last meaningful trip outside the home documented. Reverend Bogardus was also postmaster of the White Church post office, from 27 Aug 1886 to 05 Jul 1892. He later officiated Hannah's funeral. 

{{% fig "1914-05-22-ithaca-journal" "500" /%}}
</div>

A few months later, Hannah became ill and the first mentions of [Ellen Gould]({{% relref "gould-ellen" %}}) as Hannah's caretaker appear. It seems quite probable that this is an accounting of the circumstances of Ellen coming to live in the Mills' home, to care for Emily's elderly step-mother which Emily herself, as a business owner, would not have had adequate time to do. Ellen was presumably already well known to the Mills as she was also a member of the W.C.T.U.

At that time, there was a marked increase in the number of prayer and temperance meetings reported held in the Mills' home, which is perhaps not surprising as all three women of the household were so actively involved, and this would also accommodate Hannah's limited mobility. Hannah was clearly viewed as an important community leader to these women.

Hannah died 25 Feb 1917, and her funeral was held within the Mills' home. There is no direct indication that her death was related to the Influenza pandemic of that time.

Beautiful toiler, thy work all done,
Beautiful soul into glory gone,
Beautiful life with its crown now won,

Rest through God's endless, wonderful years —

Beautiful spirit, free from all stain,
Ours the heartache, the sorrow and pain,

As one would expect, George Jansen also noted that Hannah's step-son Cyrus Eastman died shortly after her:

[Hannah](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/168944385/hannah-mills) is interred at Pleasant Grove Cemetery, 184 Pleasant Grove Rd, Ithaca NY 14850, in the Thatcher family plot, and is listed on the same marker as her parents, her sister, and her sister's husband:  

  - [Thomas Thatcher](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/239203286/thomas-thatcher) (03 Jul 1785 to 17 Jun 1863), Hannah's father.
  
  - [Elizabeth (Crosby) Thatcher](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/239203315/elizabeth-thatcher) (12 Feb 1790 to 29 Mar 1873), Hannah's mother.

  - [William P. Vanderveere](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/166934176/william-vanderveere) (04 Sep 1831 to 27 May 1882), Hannah's brother-in-law.

  - [Elizabeth Vanderveere](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/166933990/elizabeth-vanderveere) (1829 to 1888), Hannah's sister.

As with Emily, the birth year on Hannah's grave is incorrect based on two independent sources: the 1900 United States Federal census that indicates Hannah was born "May 1824" in England: 

{{% fig "census/census-1900-us-inset" "800" /%}}

The exact date is reported in The Ithaca Journal, 23 May 1916, p9: "Mrs. Hannah Mills spent her ninety-second birthday Sunday, May 21." Although admittedly, the wording of this does leave some room for imprecision with regard to the exact day, it at least corroborates the month and year from the 1900 census. Yet her stone lists her birth year as 1825. 

As I write this in Spring 2022, the Thatcher stone is badly weathered and difficult to read, and the footstones are in even worse condition. The plot is in the front of the cemetery, the middle section, a few rows back from the road. The Thatcher name, and the side of the stone with Hannah's parents names, faces toward the back of the cemetery, Hannah's side faces toward Community Corners in Cayuga Heights, the Vanderveere's side faces toward Cornell. In other words, the front of the stone is facing the back of the cemetery, the opposite of what one would expect, and inconsistent with all other stones I saw, suggesting the stone was rotated at one point. 

{{% fig "thatcher/grave-photos/thatcher-full" "800" /%}}
{{% fig "thatcher/grave-photos/thatcher-zoomed" "500" /%}}

It's likely the main stone has been moved somewhat, and the footstones realigned with it. According to the Pleasant Grove Cemetery records shown below, William Vanderveere's stone is the one that appears to missing.

The transcriptions in the following photographs have also been compared against a spreadsheet of transcribed memorials from over 100 local cemeteries, compiled over several decades by Alan Chafee, Newfield Historian, relevant portions of which he shared with me via personal correspondence, April 2022.

The 2016 photos show the "MOTHER" footstone leaning against the main family stone, confirming that the stones have been moved in the past. In fact, because these photos are close-up, the direction of the camera and therefore, the orientation of the main stone, is not clear, and the main stone itself may have been turned. (As I write this, the main stone faces the rear of the cemetery, away from the road.)

    - [Sarah (Thatcher) Moot](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/50409396/sarah-moot) (1855 to 10 Jul 1942).
    
    - [Nellie G. (Thatcher) Tompkins](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/67026254/nellie-g-tompkins) (1859 to 30 May 1935). married [Monroe J. Tompkins](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/67026252/monroe-j-tompkins) (1856 to 1919). Monroe is the brother of [Myron N. Tompkins](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/188088574/myron-n-tompkins) (1859 to 21 Mar 1911), a former Dean of the Tompkins County bar and the executor of Hannah Mills' will. Nellie and Monroe's children:
  
      - [Olin M. Tompkins Sr.](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/67026256/olin-m-tompkins) (1888 to 1972).

      - [Myrtle C. Talbott](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/80863372/myrtle-c-talbott) (1892 to 1981).
      
      - Monroe Earl Tompkins (24 Jan 1897 to 07 Jun 1963).
    
    - [Edward C. Thatcher](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/122023540/edward-c-thatcher) (1863 to 04 Jun 1937). Married [Blanche M. Thatcher](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/122023541/blanche-m-thatcher) (1886 to 24 Sep 1968)

    - [Minnie A. (Thatcher) Smith](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/86690565/minnie-a-smith) (1867 to 23 Jun 1936). Married [Dr. William A. Smith](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/86690515/william-smith) (01 Feb 186? to 31 Mar 1934), former Tompkins County Coroner. Minnie's obituary notes: "she is survived by two daughters, Mrs. Agnes Shulman of Ithaca and Mrs. Alleine Estabrook of Newfield...". 

Currently unknown:

  - Edgar Thatcher. I initially thought this was a mistaken reference to Edward Thatcher, and that is still a possibility, but I have seen this name referenced in a few places, so perhaps not. I have been unable to identify this person.

  - Silas Thatcher, a "farm laborer" listed in the 1850 federal census living with the Thatcher family, and in the 1860 federal census was living with a family by the name Fleming. He also indicates England is his origin, and given his age, he is likely Thomas Thatcher's brother. (A possible daughter: [Sarah C. (Thatcher) O'Brien](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/79475027/sarah-c-o'brien).) 

Both the Thatchers and the Tompkins families are associated with the towns of Newfield and Catharine, with Edward living in Cayutaville, and a few descendants living in Ithaca.

Hannah's immigration information is based on naturalization documents of her brother David Thatcher from 1839, that are on still on file with the Tompkins County Clerk's Office. I conclude this document identifies Hannah Mills' brother based on the document matching several known data points: first and last name, town of residence, age, country of origin, and the voyage happened within the expected timeframe. As a result, I am also using this document as the source for David's exact birthdate, as prior to seeing this, I only knew the year.

{{% fig "thatcher/1839-david-thatcher-naturalization-003" /%}}

Elizabeth Vanderveere appears to be Hannah's sister, based on the following data points:

  - The 16 Oct 1850 United States Federal census shows the Thatcher family in Newfield with a 21 year old woman named Elizabeth. The age and birthplace are consistent with this being Thomas and Elizabeth's daughter, and matches the age of Elizabeth Vanderveere.
  - The 01 Jun 1865 New York State Census shows Hannah and Charles Eastman living with 36 year old Elizabeth Thatcher, identified as "sister in law" and 75 year old Elizabeth Thatcher identified as "mother in law".
  - The 04 Aug 1870 United States Federal census shows William and Elizabeth Vanderveere living with the widowed Elizabeth (Crosby) Thatcher. Both Elizabeth Thatcher and Elizabeth Vanderveere list England as their birthplace.
  - And obviously, the Vanderveere's are buried in the Thatcher family plot.

I have contacted several living descendants of David Thatcher, and Joan Taber of Newfield appears to be the one with the greatest knowledge of the family history, having preserved many artifacts and performed her own research over the years. At one time, she thought she may have had a photo of David Thatcher, and she also believes she has some Eastman materials. According to Joan and another descendant, there are family anecdotes about Thomas Thatcher ringing the church bells in England, and there are references in their documents to a "Mercy Thatcher" although nobody seems to know who this person might be exactly. 

## The Eastmans

Charles Eastman had a daughter [Hannah (Eastman) Meaker](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/80753410/hannah-meaker) (15 May 1843 to 20 Dec 1881), who appears to be Cyrus' twin sister and wife of George M. Meaker. George M. Meaker's parents are [Reuben E. Meaker](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/80752505/reuben-e-meaker) (1823 to 09 Jun 1894) and [Elsie (Briggs) Meaker](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/80752649/elsie-meaker) (1824 to 09 Mar 1893). Hannah and George's children include two daughters, [Mamie Elsie (Meaker) Crance](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/187482089/mame-crance) (15 Jan 1873 to 13 Oct 1955) and [Ida Adelia (Meaker) Husted](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/231453734/ida-adelia-husted) (21 Jul 1878 to 08 Jul 1958) 

There is another Hannah Eastman in Caroline at this time: [Hannah V. (Smith) Eastman](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/91574581/hannah-v-eastman) (1826 to 05 Feb 1892) who was married to [Reuben B. Eastman](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/91575045/reuben-b-eastman) (Jun 1829 to 15 Nov 1913), Charles C. Eastman's brother.

Charles C. Eastman had a son [Charles Henry Eastman](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/116398712/charles-henry-eastman), so references to "Mrs. Charles Eastman" may also need to be disambiguated. As evidenced by the deeds below, Charles Henry Eastman's family moved from Danby to Michigan by 1891.

All that in mind, I believe all of the deeds that follow are referencing Hannah Mills:

I have contacted one descendant of Charles C. and Polly Eastman, Jodi Leaf, and she is the most knowledgable Eastman family historian, having done much of her own research, and contributing genealogies, photos, etc. to findagrave.com and ancestry.com. Numerous family photos exist starting with the children of Charles C. and Polly Eastman.
