Note that James A. Hillyer also had a son named Horace who followed him in the grocery business. 

Horace worked as a clerk in his father's dry goods store in Corfu, E. H. Mills & Co. Horace died by a gunshot wound a few years before the Mills moved to Motts Corners.

Horace lingered for several days. The records of Evergreen Hill Cemetery are therefore inaccurate.

Presumably, the fact that the family moved away from Corfu a few years after his death is more than coincidental, but that is speculation. However, this could also explain why Emily was so active in the [temperance movement]({{% relref "temperance" %}}), if alcohol was a factor in Horace's death. I have taken an initial photographic inventory of every page of the Good Templars meeting minutes, and I intend to read these more closely for clues.

And a very big mystery relevant to the Caroline audience in particular, is why they chose Mott's Corners as their next destination? At this point, I have only a few vague theories to explore.

  - If the Caroline area was a particularly active area for Temperance, that could have been a draw. But, it is unclear if anyone in Emily's family were involved in temperance in Corfu.
  - They knew someone who lived Mott's Corners. One possibility I am exploring is the presence of (possibly related) [Hallocks in Caroline]({{% relref "hallock"%}}) at the time.
  - Perhaps Edward sold products from the mills and factories of Mott's Corners in his store and knew of it that way?
  - As Edward Mills appeared to have multiple business relationships with Edward Lounsbery, perhaps that offers at least a partial explanation. 

Horace is [interred](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/75958913/horace-f-mills) at Evergreen Hill Cemetery, 112 Alleghany Rd, Corfu NY 14036. I have contacted the cemetery, and the records that survive do not have any further date information than the year each family member died. 

### Notes for Future Researchers

There is another Horace F. Mills in upstate New York in the 1800's, who was of some prominence, but who does not appear to be closely related to this Mills family. That Horace Mills was born in 1847, lived in Penn Yan NY, attended the University at Albany in 1861 but left to serve in the Civil War, ultimately rising to the rank of Major in the 9th USCT. Several photos of this Horace Mills can be found online.

This Horace Mills may actually be a distant relative, as there are archival materials on the Mills Family at Queens Public Library that suggests that some branches of the family were in Naples NY and Buffalo NY. If true, this might also be a clue to the family's move to [Corfu]({{% relref "corfu" %}}).

Yet another Horace F. Mills lived in Wawayanda NY mentioned in Port Jervis newspapers in the 1870's and 1880's. He was married to M. J. Mills and had a daughter Bertha who died at four months old. 

And most frustrating of all is an presumably unrelated Horace Mills listed in the 1850 United Stated Federal Census as a one year old living in Darien, which is very close to Corfu:

If this Horace was still living in the area at the same time as Edward's son, and especially being of similar age, extra care should be taken to correctly identify any reporting on "Horace Mills" at the time in the local papers. 

At least some of these Mills may in fact be distant relations.
