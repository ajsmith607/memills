To the Public.

West New Brighton, March 10, 1890.

It having been the business of some person or persons to circulate false rumors concerning my connection with the firm of C. M. Pine & Son, I submit the following letter to discredit the same:

West New Brighton, S. I., March 10, 1890.

This is to certify that Michael Bohan left our employ of his own accord and that we always had the utmost confidence in his integrity and honesty; and we positively deny that we have ever uttered a word to the contrary. C. M. PINE & SON

Hoping this will be sufficient to prevent any more such nonsense, with the intention of ruining my character, I remain, Michael Bohan.
