Pine, who moved from here to West New Brighton, has received a pension certificate for $1,710, being at the rate of $73 per month from February 1890, which latter amount he will continue to receive quarterly during his life time. Mr. Pine was Second Lieutenant of Co. B, 89th Regiment,. United States Volunteers, and served three years in the late war.

Congressman Covert was largely instrumental in securing the deserved pension.
