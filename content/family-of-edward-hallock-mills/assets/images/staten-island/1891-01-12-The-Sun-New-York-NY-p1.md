TREASURER PINE SHORT $10,000. 

Will the Staten Island Building and Savings Association be a Loser? 

Alverade R. Pine of tho firm of C. M. Pine & Son, West New Brighton, was until recently Treasurer of the Staten Island Building, Loan, and Savings Association. For some time before his retirement from the Treasurership it was known among the members that there was a deficiency in his accounts. Mr. Pine has the sympathy, apparently, of nearly all the members of the association, and it is said the shortage in his accounts was not due to any wrongful act on his part. The members are reticent about the affair, but the amount of the shortage is said to be between $10,000 and $11,000. 

On Tuesday night last, at the annual meeting of the association, John F. Smith was elected Treasurer in place of Mr. Pine, whose term had expired. On Saturday the firm of C. M. Pine & Son made an assignment to Mark Hartley, with the Loan Association as the preferred creditor. Mr. Pine, the senior member of the firm, was one of the three bondsmen of his son. The other two bondsmen are Edward Clark and Robert Moore, Supervisor of Castleton. The assignment was made to protect the bondsmen. 

The firm of C. M. Pine & Son is an old house of West New Brighton, and the father and son are well known. They explain the shortage in this way: Many of the members of the association were in the habit of coming to the store and paying their monthly assessments, instead of making these payments at the regular meetings of the association. When Treasurer Pine was absent from the store, which was frequently the case, the money was paid to his father or to the clerks. Receipts were given, but the collections were not properly entered in the books of the Association. This is claimed by the Pines to be due to mistakes, and not to willful wrongdoing. In this way the accounts of the association got mixed up with the firm's account. 

Ex-Treasurer Pine is about 35 years old, and is a widower. His reputation as a business man has always been good. His bondsmen, it is expected, will make good the amount of the shortage to the association. The latter has been in existence for about twelve years, and has a large membership. At the last meeting of the association, when Treasurer Pineâ€™s shortage was discussed, a resolution was passed providing that hereafter the payment of no moneys on account of assessments would be recognized if paid outside of the building.
