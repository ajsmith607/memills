  - From Historic Richmond Town: 'Trade card. Chromolithograph on paper. Illustration of a basket of fruit. Inscription printed on the reverse: "HILLYER & EGBERT, / DEALERS IN / First-Class Groceries, / HARDWARE, WOODEN WARE, CROCKERY, / PAINTS, OILS, FLOUR, FEED, HAY and STRAW, / RICHMOND TERRACE, / Foot of Columbia St. / WEST BRIGHTON, STATEN ISLAND." This is a "stock card" (a generic trade card to which the advertiser added his specific information). Hillyer & Egbert was a grocery store in West New Brighton operated by Barnett Egbert Jr. (1837-1916) and his brother-in-law James A. Hillyer (1832-1925). The store was mentioned frequently in the Richmond County Advance in the late 1880s. The newspaper's "Jottings" column on May 15, 1886, stated "Down again! Hillyer & Egbert have reduced their prices again, on Butter, Flour, Sugar, Rice, starch, Molasses, Lard, and Turkish prunes. Let nobody go hungry now."'
