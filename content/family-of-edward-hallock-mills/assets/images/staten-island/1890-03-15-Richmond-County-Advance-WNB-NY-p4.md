Recent attempts have been made by scandal-mongers and gossips to injure the reputation of groceryman Bohan of West Brighton, by circulating rumors to the effect that he was discharged from the employ of Messrs. C. M. Pine & Son, and throwing reflections on the young manâ€™s character. Mr. Bohan has been considerably annoyed by these cowardly insinuations, and in order to prove the falseness of the rumors, he applied to the Messrs. Pine for a letter, which we publish in another column. Gossip mongers  should be careful how they talk.
