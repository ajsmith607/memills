Look out for the Ruts

Shortly after noon on Thursday, while George Hyer was driving Bartlett Brown's grocery wagon on Elm street, near Castleton avenue, West Brighton, a wheel came off, allowing the axle to drop to the ground, This frightened the horse, which started to run, but George wound the lines around his hands and tried to hold the excited animal. He was unable to do so, however, and a moment later the wagon collided with a telephone pole, throwing the driver, and a boy who was with him, to the sidewalk. Fortunately neither was injured, but the wagon-top was badly shattered. The horse continued its mad career toward Broadway, where it was caught and stopped by Bartlett Brown, Jr., who rushed out of the store when he saw it coming and seized the bit, unheading the danger of such proceeding. Several people came instantly to his assistance. "Bartie" only received a slight scratch, but the lesson to be learned from this accident is that wagons should be inspected frequently.
