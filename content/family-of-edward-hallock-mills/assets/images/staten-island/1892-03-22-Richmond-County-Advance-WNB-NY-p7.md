OBITUARY.

PINE.—Elmira J., wife of Charles M. Pine, died at her home in West Brighton on Monday, in her 77th year. Funeral services were held at the house on Wednesday. Rev. Dr. Brownlee and Rev. A. H. Demarest officiating, and the interment was in the family plot at the Moravian Cemetery. The exercises at the funeral were of a very interesting character, and it is worthy of notice that the two clergymen in attendance were pastors of the church of which Mrs. Pine had been a consistent member for nearly forty years, and were thus better than any one else able to speak of her religious life during that period. Dr. Brownlee based his address upon the words “There remaineth a rest for the people of God,” and spoke with the point, vigor, and earnestness which have always characterized his public utterances. He paid a feeling tribute to the work of the departed, and particularly referred to her patiences and submission in the midst of the severe sufferings which she was often compelled to undergo. Mr. Demarest followed with appropriate remarks based upon the words “For me to live is Christ, to die is gain.” Dr. Brownlee closed the services with a fervent prayer and benediction. Mrs. Pine was well known to a large circle of Christian and benevolent workers as one of the most active and zealous in the performance of duty. In the Ladies Aid Society of her own church she accomplished much good and was largely instrumental in gathering a large sum of money to be used toward the erection of a new Sunday School building. As one of the Managers for many years of the Old Ladies Home at Stapleton she was also highly esteemed for faithful work for the cause, and loving ministry to the inmates. She will be remembered and missed by many others toward whom she manifested kindly regard, and whose lives she sought to bless.
