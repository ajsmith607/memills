**BARTLETT BROWN**

Bartlett Brown Senior, died at his residence, No. 114 Broadway, West New Brighton, on Monday afternoon last, aged sixty-nine years and eight months. His sickness dates from the beginning of last summer, but it did not take a very serious turn until about ten weeks ago after which time he was confined to his bed, gradually growing weaker until his death. He often suffered severely, but the close of his life was very peaceful. During all of the very trying period of his sickness, he was cheerful, patient and submissive, and no murmur ever escaped his lips. The Doctors Coonley, who attended, on being called, pronounced the disease incurable, and a post-mortem examination by Dr. Frederick Coonley confirmed the correctness of the opinion.

Mr. Brown was born at Oak Farm, Long Island, and was one of ten children. His parents were among the most intelligent and estimable people of that section, and he was trained to many kinds of usefulness on the farm from a very early age. Indeed, the experiences which then came to him were invaluable, and fitted him in a superior degree for the diligent, manly and honorable life which succeeded.

He began business for himself as a coal and wood merchant in the city of Brooklyn, but later, **in the year 1857, he accepted a position in the grocery store of Charles M. Pine at West Brighton, and remained there, highly esteemed by the proprietor and by the many customers, until the year 1859, when he purchased the valuable property at the corner of Broadway and Castleton avenue and began business in the same line for himself. He resided in the adjoining house with his family.** He was a man of the very strictest integrity in all of his affairs, and with the merchants of the city with whom he dealt, and with the other people with whom he had financial relations, he was held in the highest regard. In 1892 he retired from active life.

He set a fine example with regard to everything in which he was engaged during the forty-seven years when he made Staten Island his home. Beside the store he had a profitable cranberry business at Calverton, L.I., which he sold to a brother two years ago.

For the two years previous to his death he gave much attention to the affairs of the Richmond County Mutual Insurance Company, of which he was President, and was interested in a reorganization and placing the company in such a condition that it would be more productive. **Prior to his election as President he was a director, having taken the place of Mr. Pine on the death of that gentleman a considerable number of years ago.** He was always reluctant to hold any office, although frequently solicited and urged to do so.

As a private citizen, he was unexceptionable in all his conduct; he stood for righteousness at the ballot-box, purity in the affairs of the nation and of society, an increase in educational facilities, and a supreme belief in the value and importance of a religious character. He was a friend when a friend was most needed, and many a worthy cause has been benefitted by his generosity, or helped by his judgment and advice. His influence had sometimes been very salutary over the elections in some localities, and he was often of great assistance in the overthrow of evil. He was never afraid to stand boldly up against anything that was wrong and he was a fearless advocate of the truth.

In his religious life Mr. Brown was consistent and faithful. A considerable number of years ago, when Mr. Abraham C. Wood of West Brighton was superintendent of the Sunday-school in Franklin Hall, Mariners Harbor, and was obliged to walk each Sunday to attend to his duty, Mr. Brown tendered his horse and carriage and himself to relieve Mr. Wood of his journeys. As a result, Mr. Brown became a teacher in the school, and for several years did faithful duty in that line; and the girls and boys of the Bible classes which he taught, now grown to manhood and womanhood, speak of the profit they received from his instruction. For a long period he was an earnest member of the Reformed Church of Port Richmond, and every Sunday, without regard to weather, the time was occupied by his family and himself with ardent work for the cause. Personal service and liberal contributions were combined.

Later it was found more convenient to attend Calvary Church, near their home, and the Rev. Mr. Demarest, the pastor of the Reformed Church, gave them a very complimentary letter to the Rev. Dr. Leggett, the pastor with whose charge they desired to unite, where they found further opportunities for usefulness.

Funeral services were held at the house on Wednesday afternoon last, the Rev. Dr. Leggett officiating and speaking words of sympathy and helpfulness as well as of appreciation of the estimable qualities of him whose life had ceased. The funeral was private, except for immediate relatives and the officers and directors of the Richmond County Mutual Insurance Co., most of whom were present. The interment was on Thursday morning in the family plot in the Moravian Cemetery.

Floral designs of choice and beautiful flowers, tributes of regard from friends, covered and surrounded the casket. There was also a sheaf of wheat.

The widow and son and daughter who survive have the warm sympathy of a multitude of friends in their bereavement.
