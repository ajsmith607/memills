Mr. Charles M. Pine of West Brighton is serving his fortieth year as a member of the Consistory of the Reformed Church at Port Richmond. He has served continuously during that period-first as deacon and later as elder, and has held the high esteem of pastor and people throughout his entire official career. In a consistent Christian life, including a generous liberality toward every benevolent cause, Mr. Pine has been a noble example to all.
