notes: >-

  - The following information on "Description", "Ownership and History", and "Print size" is from Historic Richmond Town:
  
  - "Description": Original B&W print on cream cardboard mount with rounded corners and gold beveled edges. Front view of a two-story wooden house with two-story porch, spring eave roof, and clapboard siding. There is a picket fence in front of the house. Several steps lead up to the first-floor porch, which has vines growing on both sides. Both porches have narrow Doric style columns and railing with flat, shaped balusters. At right, a picket fence with an open gate leads into an area at the side of the house. A brick building is partially visible at far left. Handwritten inscription on reverse of mount: "Pine Residence / W.N.B. S.I. N.Y." Stamped inscription on reverse of mount: "C.M. STEINROCK, / BIRDSBORO, / BERKS CO., PA.

  - "Ownership and History": This building was the home of Charles M. Pine and family in West New Brighton, Staten Island; it was previously the Swan Hotel. Mr. Pine and his son C. Theodore Pine operated a grocery and dry goods store on Richmond Terrace in West New Brighton. ..."

  - "Print size": 6x7.875

  - Note that the "brick building...partially visible at far left" is Charles Pine's grocery store, known at different times as Pine Hillyer & Co. and C. M. Pine & Son, where both Edward Mills and Bartlett Brown worked in the 1850's.

  - There is a utility pole in front of the home. The Staten Island Historical Society says the photograph is "ca. 1895", roughly coinciding with the death of Theodore. But also note that elsewhere it is recorded that in 1897 the "N.Y. & S.I. Electric Co. was incorporated." (1950, *Staten Island 1524-1898* by Henry G. Steinmeyer, familysearch.org.) That was the year Charles M. Pine died.
