Chas. M. Pine, the venerable ex-grocer of West Brighton, has obtained a position in the clothing store of F. W. Tompkins on the Terrace. Mr. Pine, who has been overtaken by misfortune at the age of 79 years, still retains the respect and confidence as well as the sympathy of his neighbors, after an active business career of more than half a century in their midst.
