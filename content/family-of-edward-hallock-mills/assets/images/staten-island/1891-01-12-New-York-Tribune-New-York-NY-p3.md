STATEN ISLAND. 

WEST NEW BRIGHTON.â€”Alverade R. Pine, of the firm of C. M. Pine & Son, was until recently treasurer of the Staten Island Building, Loan and Savings Association. For some time previous to his retiring from the treasurership, it was known among the members that there was a deficiency in his accounts. Mr. Pine has the sympathy, apparently, of most of the members of the association, and it is claimed that the shortage in his accounts was not due to any wrongful act on his part. The members are reticent about the affair, but the amount of the shortage is said to be about 10,000. On Tuesday night last, at the annual meeting of the association, John F. Smith was elected treasurer in place of Mr. Pine. On Saturday the firm of C. M. Pine & Son made an assignment to Mark Hartley, with the Loan Association as the preferred creditor. Mr. Pine, the senior member of the firm, was one of the three bondsmen of his son. The other two bondsmen are Edward Clark and Robert Moore, supervisor of Castleton. The assignment was made to protect the bondsmen. Ex-Treasurer Pine is about thirty-five years old, and a widower. His reputation as a business man has always been good, and the present difficulty in which he is involved is a surprise to many of his friends. His bondsmen, it is expected, will make good the amount of the shortage to the association.
