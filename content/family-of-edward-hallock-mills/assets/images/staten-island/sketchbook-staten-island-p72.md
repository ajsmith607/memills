CALVARY PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH, 

Of West New Brighton, was organized November 17, 1872, under care of the Presbytery of Brooklyn, with thirty-five members, **most of them previously connected with the Dutch Reformed Church of Port Richmond**. The Chapel is situated on corner of Bement and Castleton avenues, and was erected previous to the organization of the church, and for the accommodation of the Sunday-school which was started May 14, 1872, and out of which the church really grew. 

Rev. Joseph M. Greene was the first pastor, and continued his labors eight years, when he left to undertake mission work in Mexico. He was succeeded by the present pastor, Rev. Theadore A. Leggett. 

The church has had a steady growth, till now its communicants number 250. The Sunday-school is the largest on Staten Island. It is expected that a substantial church will in the near future be erected on the ground the congregation owns adjoining that which the chapel now occupies. 

TRINITY METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH 

Is at the corner of Bodine street and Shore road. Rev. S. P. Hammond is the present pastor, and the officers are: 

Trustees—**William Snedeker (president)**, **J. A. Hillyer (secretary and treasurer),** E. D. Clark, C. W. Kennedy, A. C. Gibson, William H. Lyons, David Stothers, David Houghwout and **A. C. Hillyer**. 

Stewards—**Wm. Snedeker**, Livingston Kennedy, Noah Sellick, E, Smith, William Bamber, C. E. Surdam, D. Lyons, M.D. 

The church was dedicated January 29, 1853, and improved in 1862. There is a fine clock in the tower of the building. A new parsonage is now being erected, and when completed, Trinity will be one of the finest church properties upon the Island. It now has 280 members, the Sunday-school attendance is 250, and people and pastor are in hearty co-operation.
