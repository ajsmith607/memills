NOTICE.

New Brighton, Feb. 4, 1891.

I hereby give notice, that I will receive proposals for the purchase of the entire stock, fixtures, horses, wagons, &c., assigned to me by the firm of C. M. Pine & Son. The inventory and property can be examined by intending purchasers at the store lately occupied by C. M. Pine & Son at West New Brighton, S. I.

The inventory made by the assignors states the nominal or cost value of the above mentioned property at $8,[3?]49.24, and estimates the actual value at forced sale at $4,585.75. If a satisfactory offer is not received by me very soon, I will sell the property at public auction, of which due notice will be given. 

Mark Hartley, Assignee of C. M. Pine & Son.
