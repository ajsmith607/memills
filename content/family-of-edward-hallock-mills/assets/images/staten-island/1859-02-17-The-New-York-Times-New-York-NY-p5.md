AN ATTEMPTED BURGLARY.—Tuesday night an attempt was made to commit a burglary on the premises of Bliss, Wheelock & Kelly, No. 388 Broadway. This firm occupy the first floor and basement; in the second J. Wild, Jr., & Co., carry on the business of clothiers. The lower store was closed for the night, before 7 o’clock, Wild’s being still open. About that hour Peter Noony, a private watchman, observed three men standing abreast, in front of the hall through which the firm on the second floor have ingress and egress. Attracted by their unusual position, he went forward into the entrance, where he discovered their accomplice in act of appropriating a piece of print through a hole he had made in the glass partition. The other fellows, who had been screening him at the door, ran off, and the robber finding himself detected, darted out of the hall and down White-street, closely pursued by the watchman, by whom he was at length arrested, and placed in charge of Officer Northridge.
