Pub Note	Unusual collaboration between a Scot (Johnston), an American (Rogers), and an Englishman (Stanford). The maps are all on a scale of 54.5 miles to one inch, and are very well executed. They are derived from the large Map of The United States, British & Central America, by Rogers and Johnston, 1857. The western U.S. maps show the routes of the proposed Pacific Railroad. Rogers probably wrote the descriptive text. Johnston engraved and drew the maps - these maps are perhaps the best examples of Scottish highly detailed mapmaking applied to the western territories and states, in the pre civil war period. The only other example is Black's Atlas of North America, published in 1856, but not quite as detailed in the western states and territories, although it is just as good and maybe better in the eastern areas (these two atlas had to be competitive, with their issue within one year of each other). In 1873, J. David Williams issued the Jones and Hamilton "People's Pictorial Atlas" which uses most of these maps, updated. Then in 1875 the same maps appear in the Hardesty issue of the Jones and Hamilton "Historical Atlas of the World Illustrated." (see our copies). With full and outline color. Bound in half leather dark red cloth covered boards with "Atlas Of The United States, British & Central America: By Prof. Rogers & A. Keith Johnston."
