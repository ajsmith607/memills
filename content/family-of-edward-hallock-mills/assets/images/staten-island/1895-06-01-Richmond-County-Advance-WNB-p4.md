Death of Theodore Pine.

C. Theodore Pine, whose death, at the age of 56 years, took place at his home, on Richmond Terrace, West New Brighton, Tuesday, May 28, was a well-known and highly-respected member of this community, in which most of his life was spent.

Mr. Pine was born in Hempstead, Long Island, June 20, 1839. When he was 10 years old his parents removed to West Brighton, Staten Island (then known as Factoryville), where his father, Charles M. Pine (who still survives), established himself in the grocery and general merchandise business, the firm of which he was senior member being for many years the leading one in its line on the North Shore.

Theodore remained at Hempstead, and graduated from the Academy some three years later. For a long time previous to the winding up of the concern, which occurred a few years ago, the subject of this notice was associated with his father, under the firm name of C. M. Pine & Son, and earned for himself an excellent reputation as a sagacious, straight-forward man of business, and an energetic, public-spirited citizen.

Shortly after the breaking out of the civil war, Mr. Pine, with a number of Staten Islanders—among them our present Police Commissioner, Maj. Clarence T. Barrett—enlisted in Company I, 156th N. Y. Volunteers and served with his regiment, under command of Majors-General Banks and Canby. When the celebrated Corps d’Afrique was organized, Mr. Pine was offered a commission as lieutenant in a colored regiment, which he accepted, and, after the fall of Port Hudson, he was detailed on the staff of his brigade commander, serving first as Aide and afterward as Brigade Commissary. It was while filling the latter position that he was thrown from his horse, receiving injuries to the spine from which he never fully recovered, and which finally resulted in the total loss of his sight and in the brain trouble which for several years past left him perfectly helpless, and to which he at last succumbed. Since the date of his entire disability, he has been in receipt of a pension from the United States government for the injuries received in its service, and it is a great comfort to Mr. Pine’s many friends to know that during the sad years of his helplessness he was blessed by the loving care of a devoted wife and son, whose faithful, unwearied ministrations attended him to the last moment of life.

Mr. Pine was a deacon of the Reformed Church, Port Richmond, and for twelve years served as its Treasurer. He enjoyed the warm personal friendship of the late Dr. James Brownlee, who, up to the time of his death, manifested the liveliest interest in the condition of his friend, whose sad affliction evoked his warmest sympathy.

The funeral services were held in the Reformed Church, Port Richmond, yesterday, Rev. Mr. Demarest officiating, and were largely attended. Among those present were representatives of Richmond Lodge, F. & A. M., and James A. Rice Post, G. A. R., of which the deceased was a member. The interment was in the family plot in the Moravian Cemetery, at New Dorp.
