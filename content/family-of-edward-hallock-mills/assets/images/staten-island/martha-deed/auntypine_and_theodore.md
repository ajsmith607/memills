  - Handwritten notes on the back of Theodore Pine's photograph are: "Theodore Pine as a yong [sic] man" and "Theodore his legitimate son". 

  - Handwritten note on the back of Elmira Loper Pine's photograph: "Aunty Pine". Elmira is referred to as "Auntie Pine" in Luther Milton Loper's letters to Juliett Loper, and perhaps this is how Edward Mills' children referred to her.

  - The phrase "legitimate son" may indirectly refer to Alverade's later scandal.
