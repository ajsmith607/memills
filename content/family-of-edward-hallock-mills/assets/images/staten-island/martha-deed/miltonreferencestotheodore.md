references to Charles Theodore Pine and to Jarvis Rogers Loper in Luther Milton Loper's letters to Juliett Loper 

Compiled by Martha Deed

Luther Milton Loper (1837-1865) had two close male relatives in the Civil War: Jarvis Rogers Loper (1835-1883) was his older brother, and Charles Theodore Pine (1839-1895) was his first cousin. He referred to them frequently in his letters to his first cousin, Juliett Loper. 

Note that members of the family were often called by their middle names. Thus, Luther (named after his paternal grandfather) was "Milton," Jarvis Rogers was “Rogers,” and Charles Theodore Pine (named after his father) was "Theodore." 

Milton, Rogers, Theodore and Juliett were all grandchildren of Luther Loper (1780-1856) and Sarah Bishop Loper (1786-1870). Jarvis Rogers and Luther Milton's father was their son, Isaac; Juliett's father was their son, Erastus; and Theodore's mother was their daughter, Elmira. 

Luther Milton Loper enlisted at Saratoga Springs, New York in August 1862, Charles Theodore Pine enlisted at Castleton, Staten Island, New York in August 1862, and Jarvis Rogers enlisted in the Rhode Island Volunteers (date unknown). 

Milton mentions Rogers and Theodore and the Pine family with some frequency in his letters to Juliett, including the following: 

You say Theodore was thinking about enlisting. So it seems we were both thinking of it at the Same time. and I for one decided to enlist. and did. on 6" August. left the state of N.Y. the 21‘. went to Harper's Ferry. .. Rogers is also in the Army. though not in the same Regmt that I am. . . 

Please write soon and let me know whether Theodore is in the Army. Your loving Cousin, Milton Oct 22/62 

Roger’s address is J. R. Loper, Co “I”, 2" R.I.V. Washington D C Dec 25/62 

Since I received your letter I have received one from Aunt Mary (Smith). She wrote that Theodore was with Banks Expedition, and that the boat he was in. grounded on the Florida Reefs, but he escaped unhurt. . Rogers was in the Battle at Fredricksburgh and he was unhurt. so you see we have great cause to be thankfull. we have all three of us been exposed to immediate danger and have escaped. ought we not to be thankful to our heavenly Father. who alone hath preserved our lives?

I have not yet received a letter from Auntie Pine [Charles Theodore Pine's mother]. I wish she would write. May10/63 

I don't know what Rogers. could find to write about. in order to fill 9 pages. I guess he must keep a journal. Jul13/63

I am obliged to you for sending Theodore's address. I think I shall write to him. . . How in the name of common sense, Rogers could think of enough to fill nine pages, I can't see. By the way, I received a letter from Helen, in which she stated that Rogers, wrote that his Regt was ordered to march on to Gettysburgh[sic]. I had not heard from him since. So of course did not know whether he survived to battle or not. She wrote that the papers state that his Regt lost in killed -45. I am quite anxious to hear from him

I have at last concluded to have my photograph taken, and this is the reason I write now so as to send one to you before they get damaged, for I have no convenient place for keeping them. I also inclose [sic] one for Auntie Pine. which you will please send to her. with my compliments. 

Aug 21/63 

I wrote to you last week and sent you two of my photographs, one for you, and the other for Auntie Pine, which I hope may reach their destination safely. Rogers is acting Brigade Hospital Steward, So he and Theodore are both in good and comfortable situations, better off than Iam. . . 

Aug 28/63 

I sent two of my photographs in the letter, one of which I of course intended for you. the other was for Auntie Pine. I hope you will get yours all right. I did receive the letter in which you requested me to direct to Staten Island, but forgot to do so. I will try to direct this one right. 

Sep 15/63 

Note: Pine family lived on Staten Island. 

Rogers is in Virginia somewhere. The letter I received from him yesterday was mailed from Alexandria, but his address is, Washington. D. C. as before, or in other words, it is Mr. J. R. Loper. Co. 9 2 R.I. Vols., Washington, D. C.

I am glad to hear that Grand Ma's [Sarah Bishop Loper] health is better. than when you last wrote. and that Theodore is rising in the world. Nov 19/63 

Note: Reference may be to Theodore being promoted to 2nd Lt. and joining U.S. Colored Troops in October 1863. 

I suppose Theodore enjoyed himself more at that dinner party. than I would have done. could I have had the privalige [sic]. for I am not very social, which you perhaps well know. . . Rogers wrote that He. had just received a letter from Cousin Mary G[?]. Buffet. He said he dreaded to answer the letter, but could not very well get around it. 

Jan 7/64 

I would like to write to Theodore. but have forgotten his address. please give me it again. and I will copy is so that I can write whenever I have an opportunity. I wrote to him about the first december last but did not direct as you told me but guessed at his Address-- and now. I guess. that I didnt guess right. this was before you sent his address

I found a letter there for me from Theodore, which surprised me somewhat. It was written the 2™ of April. He was well at the time. May 27/64 

Rogers is now Hospital Steward. And gets 30$ per month. And [illegible]. So he is above me now, and will be I suppose until I get a Commission. He has been more fortunate than I have, he went into an old Regt as a recruit so of course did not stand so good a right for a promotion as if he had enlisted with the Regt but he has worked his way to a very good and admirable position. I went into the service a Sergt and am only first Sergt yet. 

Jun 27/64 

I hope Theodore is well by this time. Patients in Hospital do not get the “best of care.” as one would conclude after reading the papers. Aug 16/64 

I received a letter from Roger to night. He is near Harper's Ferry and say they have to change their position quite often. Sep 19/64 

I think it will be as well for Theodore to remain at home now. that is. after he gets there. which I hope he will do soon. After one has been in the service two or three years. I think he has done his share. though if he is really anxious to do more I am willing he should. but shall not advise him to. Oct14/64 

I received a letter from Brother Rog. the other day. It seems He conducted himself in such a manner. during Sheridan's operations in the "Valley" (in his capacity of Hospital Steward of course) as to fain the approbation of the Div Surgeon who subsequently was appointed Inspector (Judicial) and took Rogers with him in the office to do his writing, which Rog says he finds very easy and comfortable position. He is at Winchester, Va. and says he owes his position. to his attending to his "Biz" while in the field. 

Nov 6/64 

I recd.. one a few days later from Rogers written the same day. He was well and so well pleased with his situation. that he thinks of going into the regular service. If he was in my place. here at the front. obliged to get up at four and five oclock every morning and stand in line of battle until day light. besides being routed out and midnight about twice every week. He would not be so fast for continuing in the service. 

Nov 21/64 

-Rogers proposes to meet me somewhere in New York, and go home together. I have named Staten Island as a substitute — won't it be pleasant for us to meet there? May 19/65 

Rogers has some peculiar notions about some things and it may not suit his convenience to meet me on S. I. [Staten Island] so I have written him that I will meet him wherever he directs. Jun 5/65
