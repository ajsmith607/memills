  - Handwritten note on the back of Elmira Loper Pine's photograph: "Aunty Pine". Elmira is referred to as "Auntie Pine" in Luther Milton Loper's letters to Juliett Loper, transcribed by Martha Deed, and perhaps this is how Edward Mills' children referred to her.

  - The photographic studio imprint is "Jordan & Co. Ltd. 229 Greenwich St. Established 1846".
