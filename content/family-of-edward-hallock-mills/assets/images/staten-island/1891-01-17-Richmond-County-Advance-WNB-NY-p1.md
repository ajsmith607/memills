**Failure of an Old Firm**

The people of West Brighton were greatly surprised on Saturday last by the report that C. M. Pine & Son had failed. Charles M. Pine, the senior member of the firm, had been engaged in the grocery and general merchandise business in the community for nearly half a century, and was, at one time, reputed to be worth nearly or quite $25,000. It was, therefore, as many said, about the last concern on the North Shore that would have been expected to fail. The news spread rapidly, and everyone began to ask what had caused so unexpected an occurrence. The facts, briefly stated, appear to be these:

For several years, C. Theodore Pine, the junior member of the firm, was treasurer of the Staten Island Building-Loan and Savings Association. His health failed about two years ago and he lost his eyesight. His brother, Alverade R. Pine, who was a clerk in the store was then elected to the treasurership of the Association, as everybody had implicit confidence in the family. It now comes out that the funds of the Association have been used in the business of the firm in a free and easy manner year after year, unknown and unsuspected by the directors and auditors of the Association, until is is now suddenly discovered that there is a shortage in his account amounting to about $10,000. 

When this became known, C. M. Pine & Son, the former of whom was one of the bondsmen, made an assignment in favor of the other two bondsmen, Edward D. Clark and Robert Moore, with A. R. Pine as a preferred creditor. The later then made an assignment of his claim on the assets of the firm (also turning over a mortgage and his household furniture) and made the Building-Loan Association his preferred creditor. Mark Hartley of New Brighton is the assignee.

A special meeting of the stockholders of the Association was held, on Wednesday evening, but President Westbrook stated that the auditors were not yet prepared to make a full report, notwithstanding the fact that they have been working on the accounts until late at night ever since the assignment. There were several matters which they had been unable to get at thus far, but they hoped to get them all straightened out before the next regular meeting. O. P. Geoffroy, one of the auditors made a partial statement, which indicated a shortage of $9,056.53 in cash, and a deficiency in vouchers drawn on the treasurer amounting to $1,998.45, making a total of $11,054.98. They expect that a further examination will reduce this sum considerably. Secretary Wheeler stated that it would be necessary for them to call in all the passbooks of parties who appear to be in arrears on his books before the exact shortage could be determined.

Mr. C[undlear] asked if there was any likelihood of the Association losing anything. Mr. Clark said he did not see how it could lose one cent. Should there be anything lacking after the assignment is settled, the businessmen will have to make it good. He, for one, expected to meet that obligation. Daniel [unclear] declared that the auditors and directors had been deceived by Treasurer Pine, [text unclear] some way to deposit in bank so that he could show a certificate of deposit for the amount the books called for, and then, perhaps, drawn it out the next day after the auditors had examined his account-!

Mr. Brill—that does not exonerate the auditors and directors of this Association. I joined in good faith and with full confidence in the officers, but if I had known what I do now I would never have put a dollar in here!

President Westbrook reminded the gentleman that each member of the Association was at fault if the officers were. The trouble had come about as a result of the lax methods under which they had been satisfied to do business. There had been no check on the treasurer, either in depositing or drawing out money. At the annual meeting, however, resolutions had been adopted requiring the treasurer to show the president a certificate of deposit within 24 hours after the money is received, and no money can be drawn out without the signatures of the president and secretary. All moneys must hereafter be paid in at the office of the Association. To make it easier for members to do this, the secretary will sit at the Richmond County Savings Bank (in the same building) on the Saturday evening previous to the regular monthly meeting (the second Friday evening of each month), and the Saturday evening following the monthly meeting. The money taken in at such times will be deposited before leaving the building, as the savings bank is authorized to receive deposits for the Bank of Staten Island. 

W. H. Prall said a report reflecting the clerks in Pine’s store had been published in some of the papers. He thought it very unjust that these young men should be charged, even by insinuation, with appropriating any of the money belonging to [the Association?]. No one present believed such to be the case, for so many incorrect statements about these matters get in the city papers that people make allowance for them. The meeting adjourned till Tuesday evening, Feb. 10th, when the auditors will make a full report.
