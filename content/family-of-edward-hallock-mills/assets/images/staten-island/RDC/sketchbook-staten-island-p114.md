A new brick church was built from material manufactured in a field, a few rods west of its site, in 1787, and it was in this church that Daniel D. Tompkins, Vice-President of the United States and his family worshipped.

The present church edifice was built upon the site of the former one, and dedicated in February, 1846. The present pastor, Rev. James Brownlee, D.D., was ordained and installed in August, 1835, and last year celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of his pastorate.
