    - "Duane Reade Inc. is a chain of pharmacy and convenience stores owned by Walgreens Boots Alliance. Its stores are primarily located in metropolitan New York City, NJ, Nassau, Suffolk Westchester, Rockland and Fairfield Counties and known for high-volume, small store layouts in densely populated Manhattan locations. ...Founded in 1960, the chain was started with three stores by Abraham, Eli, and Jack Cohen, with a warehouse located between Duane Street and Reade Street on Broadway in Lower Manhattan. Duane Reade takes its name from the company's first successful full-service drugstore, which opened in 1960 on Broadway between Duane and Reade Streets in TriBeCa just north of the Financial District. The streets themselves were named after early American politicians James Duane (1733-1797) and Joseph Reade (1694-1771)." ([Duane Reade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duane_Reade), Wikipedia.org.)
