The saddest thing in connection with the recent failure of C. M. Pine & Son is, that the senior member of that firm, who is now past his 80th year, is left penniless. After an active business career of more than half a century, during which time he commanded the respect and confidence of the community, he has lived to see the fruits of his labor swept away, at a time when he is utterly powerless to prevent. He has the heartfelt sympathy of the community in his distress.
