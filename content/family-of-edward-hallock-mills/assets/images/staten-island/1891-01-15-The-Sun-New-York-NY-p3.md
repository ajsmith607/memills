Treasurer Pineâ€™s Shortage.

The members of the Staten Island Building, Loan and Savings Association held a meeting last night in New Brighton to discuss the shortage in the accounts of Alverade R. Pine, who was until recently Treasurer of the Association. President John Westbrooke said a full statement of the Treasurer's accounts could not be presented, as the auditor was not prepared to make a report. As near as could be ascertained the shortage was $9,665.80. To meet this deficiency Mr. Pine and his father, who was his bondsman, had made an assignment of their business and property. A resolution was adopted to employ an accountant to examine the accounts and report to the association at their meeting on Tuesday, Feb, 10. 

President Westbrooke said he supposed a large number of the members felt as though some proceedings ought to be taken against Pine, but in view of the fact that the latter had made an assignment he did not think it would be policy to begin any legal proceedings against Pine.
