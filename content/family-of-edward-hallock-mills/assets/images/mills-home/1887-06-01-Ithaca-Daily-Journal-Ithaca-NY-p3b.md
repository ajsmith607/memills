  - According to [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/welkin) "welkin" is defined thusly: "This heavenly word has been used in English to refer to the vault of the sky for centuries, and it derives from an Old English word meaning "cloud." In current English, welkin is still flying high, and it is often teamed with the verb ring to suggest a loud noise or an exuberant expression of emotion, as in "the welkin rang with the sound of the orchestra" or "her hearty laugh made the welkin ring." These contemporary phrases echo an older useâ€”the original words of a carol that once began "Hark, how all the welkin ring," which we now know as "Hark! The herald angels sing.""

  - The 137th was William Benton Wolcott's Regiment.

  - Ara Lucy (Gass) Walsh Holland was the daughter of [Judge John W. Gass](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/128253884/john-w-gass) (1843 to 19 Jan 1900) and Rebecca (Richardson) Gass. Judge Gass was a Civil War veteran in the Thirteenth Illnois Calvary, and he was a member of the David Ireland Post of the Brookton G.A.R. As the result of a spinal wound received in the War, he was confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. He was an attorney, a former Justice of the Peace, and Loans Commissioner. The family moved to California by the early 1890's, and Ara continued to sing for church and community organizations into adulthood.

BROOKTON.

Memorial Day was observed in Brookton as never before. Early in the morning wagon loads of people could be seen on their way to the village to unite with the members of the Ireland Post in the observance of the day. At the appointed hour forty or more veterans of the war formed in line and followed by a throng of citizens under command of the commander of the Post proceeded to the cemeteries where the graves of their deceased comrades were decorated in accordance with the beautiful and impressive ritual of the G.A.R., which was well rendered by the respective officers of the Post. The long column them marched to the Congregational church where they broke ranks and partook of their dinner. A magnificent table, groaning with the good things which the ladies of Brookton know well how to prepare, was found waiting for the musicians and the invited guests. At one o'clock the Congregational church was crowded from front to rear, seats having to be placed in the aisles to accommodate the throng that gathered to hear the oration of the Hon. Walter G. Smith, whose effort was a masterly one and thoroughly pleasing to all. The music of the Brookton brass band was rendered in a very excellent manner. The veteran fifer, Moses Roe, with his drum corps and the identical file that made the music for the 137th Regiment on their "march to sea," were there and made the welkin ring. A recitation by Ara Gass (a little miss of 7 years) entitled "Crown our Heroes," took the house by storm. The male quartette rendered several appropriate selections with much credit to themselves. In all respects the observance of the day was complete.
