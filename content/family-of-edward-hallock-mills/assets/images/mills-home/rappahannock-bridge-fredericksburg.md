  - The photograph indicates this was taken May 1863, and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Franklin's_Crossing) states that this photograph was taken at Franklin's Crossing, also known as the "lower crossing" at the Battle of Frankin's Crossing, also known as the Deep Run Battle, that took place 05 Jun 1863. [Civil War in the East](https://civilwarintheeast.com/us-regiments-batteries/new-york-regiments-and-batteries/artillery-and-engineers/50th-new-york-engineers/) shows that the 50th Engineers were engaged in "operations at Deep Run Ravine" Jun 5 to Jun 13, immediately preceding the Gettysburg campaign. Notice the similarities in the scenes depicted between this photo and the bronze bas-relief on the 50th Engineers monument at Gettysburg.
