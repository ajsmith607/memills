F. D. Gilbert, Funeral Director, Dies 

Funeral services for Fred D. Gilbert, 68, a funeral director for 32 years, will be held at 2:30 p. m. Monday in the First Presbyterian Church. 

Mr. Gilbert died at his home, 125 E. Buffalo St., Friday, Nov. 14, 1941, after an illness of about a month. The Rev. Walter A. Dodds, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, and the Rey. A. H. Boutwell, pastor of the First Baptist Church, will officiate. 

Mr. Gilbert was also known as an owner of light-harness horses. He was born at Pottersville, Pa., the son of Rev. Herbert B. Gilbert and Catherine E. Deesz. When he was six weeks old his parents moved to Brooktondale where his father served as pastor of the Congregational Church. He spent his early boyhood at Brooktondale, then moved to Cayuga Lake Park. 

Managed Waterloo Firm 

Before his marriage to Anna D. Yost of Fayette Township, Seneca County, in 1900, Mr. Gilbert was associated with Dr. J. W. Day, a specialist, in Waterloo. In 1900 he became associated with C. A. Genung in the S. J. Genung & Son funeral home at Waterloo. He served as manager of that firm from 1903 until 1909. 

During his association with Mr. Genung, Mr. Gilbert assisted the latter in the compilation of the first textbook on embalming, in the invention of instruments, and the founding of the first school of embalming. The methods they devised at the time still are the basis for many modern embalming practices. 

Came to Ithaca in 1909 

Mr. Gilbert began his funeral business in Ithaca in 1909 at 122 W. Seneca St. In 1924 he purchased the E. C. Stewart property at 125 E. Buffalo St., the present location of the Gilbert Memorial Chapel. 

Though active in civic life, Mr. Gilbert had no political aspirations. At one time he was approached as a possible mayoral candidate but he declined the nomination. 

He was a member of the Masons, IOOF, Eagles, Elks, Moose, Knights of Pythias, Veteran Volunteer Firemen’s Association, Chamber of Commerce, Rose Hill Grange of Seneca County, Tompkins County Farm Bureau, Tompkins County Fish and Game Club, Finger Lakes District of the New York Embalmers Association, and the state and national associations of funeral directors. 

Was Active in Fair 

He was a director of East Lawn Cemetery and was president and director of the Tompkins County Fair from 1922 through 1929. He was the first president of the old Tompkins County Funeral Directors Association, now known as the Finger Lakes Association. 

He served on the state board of embalming examiners. 

Mr. Gilbert did much toward the improvement of the Fairgrounds track at Trumansburg where he maintained a string of harness horses. 

Surviving are his widow, Anna D. Gilbert; one son, Carl F. Gilbert, who has been actively associated with the business for 25 years and who will carry in on, and one sister, Mrs. Catherine H. Brooks, also of Ithaca. 

Friends and fraternity affiliates may call at the home from 4 to 10 p.m. Sunday. The body will lay in state at the First Presbyterian Church from 1:30 to 2:30 p.m. Monday. 

Members of Ithaca Lodge, 636, BPO Elks, will meet at the lodge at 7:30 p.m. Sunday to visit the Gilbert home while members of the Veterans Volunteer Fireman’s Association, who will meet in their rooms at 136 E. State St., at 4:30 p.m. Sunday, will also pay their respects.
