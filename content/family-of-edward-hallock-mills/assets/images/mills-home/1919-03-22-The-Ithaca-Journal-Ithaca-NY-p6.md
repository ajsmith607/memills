BROOKTON BOY ENJOYS HOLIDAY 

Wagoner Edward C. Vorhis, Company H. 308th Ammunition Train son of Mr. and Mrs. F. C. Vorhis of Brookton, writes as follows to his parents: 

Bagueves De Luchon, France, Feb. 21, 1919. 

My dear Father, Mother and Family— 

Received your letter of January 27 O. K. and was very glad to get it and glad to hear that you had received my letter of November 10. But of course Mrs. Phillips let you know that I was all right. I am spending a seven days’ furlough in this place. Arrived here last night. Three of us are in our room and all have separate beds (Le Palace Hotel), the best hotel in town, hot and cold running water and bath, and it equals in rank among the finest I have ever seen. My expenses are all paid so it certainly is worth while. The scenery is magnificent. The resort is surrounded by the mountains, which are covered with snow and one can go out to towns in the country and take in the most wonderful scenery in the world. They could have knocked me down with a feather when I came in the place, as I thought while I was in the army I would never get to enjoy anything like this. They gave each of us a ticket that entitled us to bathe at a hot mineral bathing house. 

I have never received the Christmas box yet. Presume it was sidetracked somewhere. Quite a few of the boys never got theirs. I am glad to hear Father is improving and hope he continues to do so. Wish he was here to enjoy some of these hot mineral baths. This place is about seven miles from the Spanish border, so I think I will have Spain down in my list of countries before returning home. Will try and send all the folks cards from here. There is a large beautiful dining room in this hotel, where we get the best of food, and also served in the best of style. I am going up the mountain tomorrow on a cog railway just to take in a little more scenery. I got a letter from Russell the same day I got yours, and I guess he is well and enjoying himself. I will close for now, hoping this finds you all well and that I will be with you soon. 

With love to all, 

WAGONER EDWARD C. VORHIS
