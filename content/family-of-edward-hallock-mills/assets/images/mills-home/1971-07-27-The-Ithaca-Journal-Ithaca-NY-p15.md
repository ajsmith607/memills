Approves Fathers In Delivery Room 

By FRED YAHN 

Journal Staff Writer 

Ending five months of waiting since the motion was tabled, the Tompkins County Hospital Board of Managers Monday night approved allowance of fathers in the delivery room during childbirth by a 3-1 margin. 

No starting date has been set, but it is expected to be soon. 

“I’m very pleased with the decision. 1 think the Board of Managers did the right thing, I'm happy they saw to approve this motion,” said Dr. C. J. Kilgore, president of the hospital's Medical Board. 

The motion to allow fathers had been tabled since Feb. 15. Phil Allen, Board member, requested at that time that the matter be tabled. 

An ad hoe committee to study the question had been set up prior to the tabling action. But the ad hoc committee had been split, 2-2, on the motion. 

Last month, the ad hoc committee recommended to the Joint Conference (meeting of the Medical Board and the Board of Managers) that the motion be approved. 

The ad hoc committee consisted of Managers chairman Col. Richard Comstock, Board member M. L. Garmise, Dr. Philip H. Besancon, and Dr. Richard Murray. At first, Garmise and Murray were for the motion; Besancon and Comstock were opposed. 

The four gave their approval last month via signatures to the recommendation to the Joint Conference. 

Garmise, Allen and Mrs. Helen Hoefer voted for the motion Monday night. Arthur Cleaveland was opposed. 

Last December, the Board defeated the same proposal. Then, Comstock, Cleaveland and A. W. Chamberlain were opposed, and only Garmise was in favor. The Managers president votes only in ties. 

The hospital's obstetrical-gynecological unit and the Medical Board gave their joint approval to the motion late last Fall, but it took eight months to get the Managers to approve it. 

There is no definite date set for the start of the program. 

“It will strictly be worked out by the obstetrical-gynecological unit at the hospital. The guidelines for ‘qualifying’ a father to be in the delivery room were made clear by Dr. Murray. The father will have gone through an authorized course of instruction, and will be properly gowned and prepared to be present in the delivery room,” said Col. Comstock, who Monday night presided over his first Board meeting, having just recently been elected following Cushing Murray's resignation. 

Garmise said that Dr. Murray “did a considerable amount of work in getting the motion approved. He researched this thing thoroughly, and he deserves the credit for seeing it through.” 

Murray has since left Ithaca. It is not known where he is relocating his practice. 

Specific guidelines of educational requirements for husbands have been discussed already. When the gynecological-obstetrical unit approves one particular set of guidelines, then the program will be implemented. 

There will be a $5 charge for the couple to be able to be together during childbirth. The husband will wear a cap and gown and shoe covers and will be seated by his wife's bed in the delivery room. 

Also under the guidelines, the husband must leave the delivery room if he is asked to do so. He must also submit a written request to the hospital administrator and to the couple's private physician for permission to be with his wife at the time of delivery. 

The ad hoc committee's report referred to several insurance companies, area hospitals and legal experts in the field of malpractice and the consensus saw no objections to approval of the motion.

The Tompkins County Childbirth Education Assn. was one group responsible for much effort in support of the motion. Ex CEA president Pat Parker said she was “very pleased” with the decision. 

Under the agreement, the patient, and the physician in charge of the delivery, must come to an agreement in writing that will include “hold harmless” clauses and-or releases for Tompkins County Hospital.
