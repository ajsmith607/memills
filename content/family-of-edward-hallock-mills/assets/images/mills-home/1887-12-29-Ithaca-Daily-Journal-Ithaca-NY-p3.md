  - Coasting is "the sport of sliding on a sled down an incline covered with snow or ice". ([wordnik.com](https://www.wordnik.com/words/coasting).)

  - [George A. Richardson](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/184904049/george-a-richardson) (1887 to 22 Oct 1957), son of [George H. Richardson](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/189275611/george-h-richardson) (1862 to 26 Feb 1938), who worked for E. H. Mills for a time. 

  - Ara Lucy (Gass) Walsh Holland (31 Mar 1880 to 31 Jul 1946) was the daughter of [Judge John W. Gass](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/128253884/john-w-gass) (1843 to 19 Jan 1900) and Rebecca (Richardson) Gass (unknown to 22 Nov 1934). Judge Gass was a Civil War veteran in the Thirteenth Illnois Calvary, and he was a member of the David Ireland Post of the Brookton G.A.R. As the result of a spinal wound received in the War, he was confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. He was an attorney, a former Justice of the Peace, and Loans Commissioner. The family was from Taylorville Illinois originally, and after their time in Brookton, they moved to California by the early 1890's where Judge Gass became "one of the best known residents of San Jose" and Ara "one of the belles of San Jose society", continued to sing for church and community organizations into adulthood.

  - I am currently unaware of a familial relationship between Rebecca (Richardson) Gass and the family of George Richardson.

BROOKTON.

Coasting is a favorite sport of the young people here at present. 

W. Graham has given the operators of his knitting machines a month's vacation.

A number of the young people of this place attended the Christmas tree at Slaterville last Monday evening. 

Our school, under the efficient management of Mrs. Davenport and Jessie Campbell, is having a vacation of one week and one day.

Rev. Mr. Merrill, a former pastor here, preached at the Baptist church last Sunday. It is announced that Mr. Woodworth is to resume his labors next Sunday.

C. A. Lull, although running his mill to its fullest capacity, is unable to fill the orders for blankets. There is strong talk of doubling the force of operatives, and running the mill both day and night.

The party at the rink last Thursday evening was a decided success. Upwards of fifty couples assembled to "trip the light fantastic toe" to the music of the Brookton orchestra. A number from Ithaca were in attendance.

All enjoyed the Christmas tree at the Congregational church on Christmas eve. Before distributing the gifts an entertainment was given consisting of recitations, singing and responsive readings. The recitative powers of Ara Gass were, as usual, the wonder and admiration of all.

Among those who are spending the whole or a part of the holiday vacation with friends or relatives here are: Miss Myrtle Ault and Mr. Kent, both of the Cortland Normal School; Mr. and Mrs. James Piatt, of Towanda, Pa.; Mr. Frank King and bride, formerly of Binghamton; Mr. and Mrs. Will Fish, of Danby; Rev. Mr. Merill, of Deposit, N.Y.; Miss Eleanor Mackey, of Lycoming, N.Y.; Mr. Lewis Gale, a former resident of this place, now for several years a resident of Missouri; and Geo. Richardson, Jr., weighing nine pounds, and now a week old.
