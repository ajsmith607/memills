  - This letter from Private Earl Wolcott was published exactly three months before he died.

  - From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poilu): "Poilu (/ˈpwɑːluː/; French: [pwaly]) is an informal term for a late 18th century–early 20th century French infantryman, meaning, literally, hairy one. It is still widely used as a term of endearment for the French infantry of World War I. The word carries the sense of the infantryman's typically rustic, agricultural background. Bushy moustaches were often worn. The poilu was particularly known for his love of pinard, his ration of cheap wine."

  - In this context, “moiselles” may be a reference to wine from the Moselle valley.

HAS TAKEN PART IN THREE “KAISER KANNING PARTIES” 

Private Earl Wolcott Under Fire On Several Occasions and is Looking For More — Eight Months in France With 18th Infantry. 

The Journal has received an interesting letter from Private Earl A. Wolcott of this city, who is serving at the front with Company K of the 18th U. S. Infantry. Private Wolcott has been in the-trenches in the American sector three times, occasions which he styles as “Kaiser Kanning Parties.” His letter follows: 

“Co. K, 18th Infantry, Regulars, 

“February 18, 1918. 

“At a dilapidated little town somewhere in France. 

“The Ithaca Journal: 

“I have intended for some time past to drop you a few lines and tell you all that I am allowed by the ever vigilant censor. When I say a dilapidated town, I refer to one that is practically shot to pieces, and in danger of more to follow. While standing a few minutes this morning gazing upon what was once a beautiful little park (resembling Dewitt Park in the ‘biggest little city’) it dawned upon me that not a sign of a cat, dog or hen was in evidence. I immediately came to the conclusion that gas masks were not issued to that sort of creature. These French people are wonderful in their fine artistic ways, their patience, their bravery and after three years of terrible warfare one finds their gallant poilus with an ever ready smile. The soldiers are not alone in this gallantry, for the women of France are equally energetic in their endeavor to win the war. I have seen them work in fields, factories, and on trains. Everything is humming along in this country at a good speed, thereby proving their efficiency. The weather here is cool but not enough to cause suffering. We are well fed, well clothed, content and happy. I am sorry to hear of such reports, as have been circulated tn the States, in regard to the Y. M. C. A., the Red Cross and other fine organizations. It is false as far as we are concerned over here, for they sure are a comfort to us and a wonderful accommodation. Have had three ‘Kaiser Kanning’ trips so far and am ready for more, (resting at present). I would like to step over to the States for a few days. Just to see the progress that you people are making in the war. I suppose everybody and everything is active. Have been over here for eight months now, but all the French language I know is ‘Wee, wee,’ meaning ‘Yes, yes.’ Somehow it does not appeal to me strong moiselles (guess that’s spelled right) enough to acquire it. The mademoiselles (guess that’s is spelled right) are very, very scarce, but one is able to get lots of old men and women to chum with him. Well, give my regards to all the boys. I would answer all their letters, but of late my time has been fully occupied. Goodbye for this time, and a happy thought I'll send soaring to the ‘biggest little city,” and the sweetest spot on earth.  

“Yours, “EARL A. WOLCOTT, 

“Co. K, 19th Infantry, 

“Annex Forces, France. 

“I’m watching and waiting for the boys at Spartanburg.”
