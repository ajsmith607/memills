  - [Dr. DeForest A. Reid](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/197973243/deforest-a-reid) was a homeopathic physician who lived in the old Lockwood home at present day 480 Brooktondale Road. His name is sometimes spelled as “Reed” as seen, for example, in his obituary published 07 Jan 1908 in the Ithaca Journal directly above the obituary of Edward H. Mills. Both men’s deaths are also documented in the journals of George Jansen. Dr. Reid’s home was sold to Dr. Lockwood in October 1908. (Deeds Book 164, p494, Tompkins County Clerk, Ithaca NY.)

  - Willis Shurter’s “partly public house” is the Shurter House, “the three-story house in which Mrs. [Jessie] Brewer was born ... and in which she has always lived”. (18 Mar 1966, The Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p11.) When Brooktondale Road was updated in 1966, the Shurter House was moved to present day 449 Brooktondale Road.

  - The exclusion of Mills’ store in the report suggests it did not have its own privy associated with the property.

  - The “old tannery” of course, is Edward Lounsbery’s shop. This article was written in the final months of Edward's life.

  - The article is also written in the year prior to George Richardson's move to Ithaca.

  - Note that the Vorhis grist mill raceway is mentioned, its tail running through the Mills' home property before crossing the road on its return to Six Mile Creek.

Willis Shurter’s was the next place visited. He keeps partly public house for travelers. Privy was 16 feet from Six Mile creek on a sloping bank and was not a tight receptacle. Next place visited was the Vorhis Milling Co., and was what we would call in Brookton, the lower mill. A hog yard was on the bank of the race, yard coming close to the edge of the race. Another from the raceway and a stream from a spring runs though this hog yard towards the race. The condition of these yards and pens was bad.  

Q. —There were hogs in the yard and pen?

A. —Yes, quite a number.

Next place visited was Frank Mulks’ store. Privy was 23 feet from the pond of water. A small stream partially artificially covered runs within ten feet from same privy.

Next place visited was woolen mills. Its privy is 15 feet from pond in bad condition and without a water tight receptacle. …

…The next place visited was George Richardson’s store. The privy of this store was without any vault open on the surface of the ground. Large pile of human excrement lying on the surface of the ground. Ten feet from this was a tile drain not cemented running directly into Six Mile creek.

The next place visited was an old tannery. In this tannery was a large pile of green hides occupying a place of about 10x14 feet square and a pile of hides 4 feet high. These were green hides lying there. Then there was a pile of waste from this tannery, this comes from the vats from all appearances. This pile of waste lay on the edge of a sluice or swampy place and water running from it drained into a tributary of Six Mile creek. …
