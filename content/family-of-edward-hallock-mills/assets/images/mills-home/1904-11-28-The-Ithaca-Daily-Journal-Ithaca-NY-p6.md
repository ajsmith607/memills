STRICKEN WHILE GIVING ADDRESS.

EDWARD LOUNSBERY FALLS DEAD IN A BROOKTON CHURCH.

Was Speaking at a Meeting of the Christian Endeavor Society When Overcome—Prominent and Respected Resident of the Community.

Edward Lounsbery, a prominent resident of Brookton, dropped dead suddenly about 7 o’clock last night while speaking before the Christian Endeavor Society in the Congregational Church in that village. He had been talking but a short time when he suddenly reeled back and fell heavily to the floor. Those sitting nearby raised him up while others went for a physician. Death, however, had come instantaneously and was caused by apoplexy brought on it is thought by the mental effort he exerted in addressing the meeting. 

Mr. Lounsbery came from an old and prominent family who early settled in the vicinity of Brookton. He was born in the village 71 years ago and had always lived there. He was a member of the firm of Lounsbery & Peck, dealers in hides. Mr. Lounsbery was very active in church affairs and also was a member of the Prohibition party being one of its leaders in this county. 

He is survived by his wife and two sisters, Mrs. Culver Little of Brookton and Mrs. Fred J. Marsh of this city. The funeral arrangements will be announced later.
