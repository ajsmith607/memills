THE AUTOPHONE COMPANY

Mr. Horton Retires.

The retirement of H. B. Horton from the autophone company occurred yesterday, he having sold out his stock and interest in the concern to the other partners, Messrs. F. M. Finch, H. A. St. John and H. M. Hibbard.

Mr. Horton invented the autophone in 1876 and after experimenting with it for three years began manufacturing the ingenious instrument in company with Judge Francis M. Finch and the late H. F. Hibbard. The manner in which the idea of the autophone was suggested to Mr. Horton as related by him is quite interesting, and shows from what a small beginning the present important and profitable industry sprung. 

In the fall of '76 Mr. Horton while on his way home from the centennial exposition passed a day in New York. As he was walking along Broadway his attention was attracted by a  mechanical toy in a store window, and although he was in a hurry he step in to examine it. The device represented a boy playing upon a harmonica. It was a crude affair, but it contained a principle which our inventor thought could be developed into a useful and desirable musical instrument. During his journey home from the metropolis he continually thought of the musical toy and before reaching Ithaca he hit upon the plan of producing notes by means of perforated paper passed over ordinary organ reeds. He experimented with models for months and after producing an autophone that would play any piece of music accurately he continued to improve upon the invention until the year that he and Mr. Hibbard began manufacturing the autophones in this village. The invention proved all that Mr. Horton had anticipated and to-day the company employs some seventy-five hands and has agents in all portions of the country.
