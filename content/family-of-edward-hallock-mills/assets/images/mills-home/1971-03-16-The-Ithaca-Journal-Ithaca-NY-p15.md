Blacks’ Alienation Examined 

By ELLEN BERLE 

Journal Staff Writer 

“Blacks have not been able to buy, sneak or steal into the major institutions of this society,” said C. Dalton Jones, research associate and lecturer in black studies and psychology at the Africana Studies and Research Center, in response to a question Monday night in Statler Auditorium on the Cornell University campus. 

Jones’ two hour lecture was part of the “Biology and Society” lecture series and the first of four speeches on black culture. 

Asked if he thought the interest in African culture among blacks in the U.S. was a “cop-out,” Jones replied that on the contrary it was a “cop-in.” 

He went on to explain that “it is not a matter of having to go to Africa, but realizing that we are Africans and that that land mass (Africa) is being gobbled up like this one (the U.S.) was.” 

Jones said that opportunities were limited in finding a large and somewhat undeveloped land mass which still had the possibility of developing “human values and human communities.” 

“We will continue to exist here, but we see very little opportunity to grow in an economy and society which cares very little about human life,” he said. “Things haven't gone quite so far in Africa or the Caribbean — as far as being oriented to growth and profit.” Several times in his lecture, Jones criticized the United States for being overly specialized, too interested in a growth economy and devoid of human communities. 

He criticized the growth and profit orientation and the “super-technological” aspects of life in the United States saying that it has alienated the white technological worker as well as the black family. 

Jones also emphasized that blacks must be given autonomy over their lives and the chance to build their own communities. “Until black communities begin to take control of certain life support functions which lead to a sense of control and responsibility, there will be disruptions such as happened in the late 1960s,” he said. 

Jones’ lecture, on sociological and psychological problems facing blacks in this country, examined recent work in intelligence, self-concept and learning among blacks. 

He said that black children learn to distinguish between the black family, the black community and the larger, surrounding white society. “Every black child knows and must be able to relate to these two different environments,” he said. 

The general orientation of black people to the white environment is one of “powerlessness and low self-esteem," he said, while the orientation of black people to the black community is “purely social.” 

He also criticized studies which show that black children have a negative self-image saying that until black children go to school, they have a positive self-image from those black people closest to them such as friends, mother or lover. “Only at age five do we begin to find so called academic problems,” he said.
