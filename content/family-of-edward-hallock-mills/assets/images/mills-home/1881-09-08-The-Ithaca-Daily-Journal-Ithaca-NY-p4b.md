  - This appears to identify [Tirzah Shurter](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/98644738/tirzah-shurter) (1801 to 25 Aug 1881), who lived in the hamlet and was a neighbor of the Mills family, as indicated in the 1880 census. I have seen "Shorter" as an alternate spelling of "Shurter". Both of her children lived in Michigan.
  - Her son is [Herman B. Shurter](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/190386010/herman-b-shurter) (1830 to 21 Mar 1919). 
  - H. B. G. is likely Reverend Herbert B. Gilbert, father of Fred Gilbert, who was pastor of the Congregational Church of Mott's Corners in 1872 and 1873. In 1880, the Reverend's family, including "Freddie" at age 7 reside in the hamlet of Mott's Corners.

DIED AS SHE LIVED, ALONE. 

"Mammy" Shorter (as she was affectionately called) will no more tell us with her intense but gentle earnestness, about her valuable discoveries, and her theories, and analyses, for she fancied in her simplicity that among the glittering accidents of fortune her lands would be explored and developed and would enrich the community and lift it out of obscurity. This remarkable woman's theology may have been defective. But she seemed to carry the religion of Christ in her heart, she drew people to her by the warmth and kindliness of her nature; Her life has been a useful one; and her virtues outweigh her defects. The many who have listened with good natured indifference to her manifestly impracticable suggestions and visions, always felt a profound respect for the old lady, who was always sunny, cheerful, and uncomplaining, and they will not escape a certain sadness as they read of her death, and miss her pleasant salutations. Her devotion to her children, was touching. And they not wanting in affection, tried to induce her to live with them, and share their comforts and pleasures. But she positively refused and lived alone. The precautions taken by kind and thoughtful neighbors led to the discovery of her death at once. Her children all live in the west. Happily one son arrived a short time before the hour appointed for interment. 

H.B G. 
Motts Corners, Sept 7.
