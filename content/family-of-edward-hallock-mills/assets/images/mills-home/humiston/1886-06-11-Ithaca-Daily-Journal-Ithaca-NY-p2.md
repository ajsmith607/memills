THE HUMISTON CASE

District Attorney Smith said this morning that the Humiston case was not tried at the last term of court for the following reasons:

The complianant in the case was the Society for the Prevention of Crime. It had retained at a large cost from it own treasury ex-Judge Gabriel L. Smith of Elmira to assist the district attorney in the trial. When ex-Judge A. P. Smith of Cortland moved that the case go over the term ex-Judge Smith of Elmira arose in open court and consented because his engagements were such that if the trial extended into the following week he could not be present. As this was upon Friday and the case would undoubtedly require three or four days it was conceded that it must overlap the week then current. The two material witnesses for the people the sheriff had been unable to secure; and the unanimously expressed wish of Prof. Jones, Messrs. Nourse, March, Gee and the entire executive committee of the society was that the case be not then and there tried. 

The district attorney says that he could despite these circumstances have insisted upon trial, but had a conviction failed he would have subjected himself to just censure for obstinacy and the rejection of counsel.
