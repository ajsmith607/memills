HUMISTON IN JAIL.

A busy Saturday and Sunday.

He Left For Rochester This Morning.

When H. N. Humiston was placed in the hand of the sheriff by Judge Lyons last Friday noon, he trembled violently, and it was evident to all that he felt his position keenly. As he passed into the jail, he completely broke down, and showed the greatest agitation. He was first taken in the lower corridor in which were eighteen or twenty criminals of all grades. Humiston looked over the motley crew, and shuddered as he those with whom he was expected to be 

LOCKED UP.

"You can stay here until Monday," said Sheriff Tibbetts to Humiston, or you can go into the upper corridor and be locked in the cell with Will Bingham, who was convicted for robbing Emmons, who was found dead in Eaton's Ranch on State street." Humiston looked over the crowd again, and begged to be taken up stairs, where he was locked in the cell with Bingham. For a while he was completely prostrated. He had not been in the cell long before he called for the sheriff. He complained of the ventilation and said he could not possibly live where there was so little air. The sheriff explaiend to him that the ventilation was all right, and that there was no danger of his suffocating. He passed a sleepless night, but on Saturday he braced up and attended to arranging his business affairs. During Saturday and Sunday he wrote thirty or forty letters, which he gave to his friends to mail. Every possible moment he spent in writing and figuring up accounts. He also sent for a physician and attorney. It is said that the physician gave him an examination, and a certificate, the purport of which is not known. The sheriff informed our reported that from general appearances of documents made out, it was believed that 

HUMISTON MADE HIS WILL

on Saturday; but one thing was sure, he was leaving no detail of business unfinished. On his business affairs he worked all of Saturday, and nearly all of Saturday night. Toward morning he took a brief sleep, but early Sunday morning commended his writing as before. His immediate friends were admitted to the jail, and with many of them he held confidential talks. During the whole day his wife and daughter were with him in the corridor, and both were much broken down and frequently gave way to grief. At only one time while he was in jail did he appear to forget the position in which he was placed, and that was when he grew hungry. At such time he gave his order for meals as if he were at a hotel or restaurant. At noon yesterday he summoned the turnkey and says, "Have sent to me at once 

EGGS ON TOAST,

a large glass of milk, fried mush, and oat meal." The good sheriff's wife smiled as the order was given to her, as she could just as well as not, she filled the order, knowing that it would be a long while before he could successfully order such a dinner again. Just after dinner, Humiston sent for Sheriff Tibbetts. He fixed his eye on him anxiously and said "I suppose I go in the morning to Rochester, do I know?" "You will doubtless go," replied Sheriff Tibbetts. "I wish you would not let anyone know when we leave, for a I don't want to have a crowd there to see me off," said Humiston. In a few moments he said, with trembling voice, "Shall you put handcuffs on me, to-morrow?" "No, I think not, Humiston," said the sheriff. At this point Humiston burst into tears. This unexpected kindness on the part of the sheriff completely broke him down. Humiston had no reason to complain of the style of 

HIS START FOR ROCHESTER.

This morning at the G. I. & S. depot as early as 5:15, there were people waiting to see him off. Some said they did not believe he would go; many said he would play sick this morning, and one said he though he would suicide rather than go to Rochester. One of two were willing to bet that Humiston would be back in a month, but there were no takers. For the last fifteen minutes before train time all eyes were turned toward the street, everyone anxious to see how Humiston looked. The train rolled into the depot and no Humiston appeared. "I told you so," said one. "He has just played sick this morning." "He will never go to Rochester," said another. "He was down to the depot last week, and was joking about his prospect, and said when he went to Rochester we would know it. He had not idea of being convicted at that time, I know by the way he spoke."

The engine now began to show signs of uneasiness, and the baggage was all out.

"There he comes," "there is Humiston," shouted voices in the crowd, as a fine covered buggy drawn by two handsome horses, driven by the turnkey turned the corner. Humiston sat on the right hand side of the carriage, Sheriff Tibbettts on the left, and the turnkey between. All got out. Humiston crossed over from the right to the left side of the carriage, getting out on the side farthest from the depot and the crowd. He looked at the assembly anxiously, to see who was there, and the looked after his baggage. He had in his left hand a large, oblong bundle done up in brown paper tied with a strong string. Sheriff Tibbetts took out a [unclear], which Humiston took in his other hand and then they started for the cars. "Where going, Hummy?" shouted one person in a sarcastic tone.

"I am going on a brief summer vacation," said Humiston in reply. 

"Good bye Hummy," said a dozen or more voices in the crown, but with the exception of his first reply, he said nothing more. His face indicated no annoyance. He had perfect control of his features and with the exception of the weary expression on his countenance, there was nothing unusual in his appearance. He went into the forward car, ahead of the sheriff, took the rear seat in the right hand corner of the car, and there sat as the cars rolled out from the station. His back was turned the window, as if he dreaded to see the crown, or even to take a last look on the city which had for so many years been his home.
