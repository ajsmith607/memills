â€”Horace N. Humiston died at half past three o'clock Sunday afternoon of organic disease of the heart. The deceased was so well known throughout this county that any sketch of his career would be superfluous. Until his health failed about two years ago he was the personification of energy and aggressiveness, but disease very rapidly undermined his wonderful constitution and for months before his death he was extremely feeble.
