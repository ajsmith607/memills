COUNTY COURT

A very large attendance at the county court this morning indicated the great interest centering in the closing scenes of the famous Humiston case. Bets on the result have been freely made during the trial and the betting fraternity were well represented this morning, anxious to get pointers as soon as possible as to the probable result. The forenoon was occupied in summing up the case, and the judge closed his charge to the jury at 11:15. Another half hour was occupied by the defendant's counsel making requests for charges on additional points. At sixteen minutes to twelve the jury in charge of an officer retired to consider the evidence. 

Court was called this afternoon at two o'clock but it was not until three that the prisoners were brought in. Robt. Downey, James Grace, Arthur P. Saunders and Isaac Shirley made statements either personally or through counsel regarding their violation of the liquor laws, and John D. Cook, a barber, charged with appropriating funds from the Knights of Labor, was recommended to mercy by the district attorney in behalf of every witness save one who had testified against him in the case. At 3:30 the court retired to consult concerning sentences of the above. At this time the jury in the Humiston case had not reported.

SENTENCES IMPOSED.

The persons named above convicted of violating the excise law were fined $40 each, except Grace, who was convicted on two indictments and fined $80, and Shirley who had been before the court several times before was fined $125. John. D. Cook, convicted of larceny in second degree, was sentenced to the state reformatory at Elmira.

HUMISTON FOUND GUILTY

At 3:45 the jury in the Humiston case came in and reported a verdict of guilty, after which the jury was discharged. The defendant asked that the usual two days be allowed before his sentence. The district attorney demanded that the prisoners be kept in custody of the sheriff until the court should convene on Friday. As we go to press the subject of the reliability of Mr. Humiston's bondsmen was under discussion.
