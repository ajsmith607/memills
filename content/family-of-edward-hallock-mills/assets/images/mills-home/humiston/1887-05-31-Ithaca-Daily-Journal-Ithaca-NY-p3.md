COUNTY COURT

Court came together at ten o'clock this morning according to adjournment. The testimony of Judge A. P. Smith was taken in the Humiston case, he being the only witness called. Mr. McGuire made a motion that further proceedings be suspended owing to the non-jurisdiction of the court, as it was a case that properly should come before the recorder. After a brief discussion on the subject the court took a recess until two o'clock this afternoon.

Contrary to the expectation of many, the judge did not render a decision this afternoon in regard to Mr. McGuire's motion made this morning. Several witnesses were called, among them Mrs. Humiston, wife of the defendant; also his son. Various other witnesses were called to prove and disprove the reliability of witnesses. The case is still in progress as we go to press.
