  - “Erysipelas (/ˌɛrəˈsɪpələs/) is a relatively common bacterial infection of the superficial layer of the skin (upper dermis), extending to the superficial lymphatic vessels within the skin, characterized by a raised, well-defined, tender, bright red rash, typically on the face or legs, but which can occur anywhere on the skin. It is a form of cellulitis and is potentially serious. Erysipelas is usually caused by the bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes, also known as group A β-hemolytic streptococci, which enters the body through a break in the skin, such as a scratch or an insect bite. It is more superficial than cellulitis, and is typically more raised and demarcated. The term comes from the Greek ἐρυσίπελας (erysípelas), meaning \"red skin\".” ([Erysipelas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erysipelas), Wikipedia.org.)

–Jasper M. Humiston who had his foot badly crushed between the cars at the Inlet some twelve weeks ago, has suffered a relapse brought on by over exertion in walking to the registry board last Tuesday. The injured foot is badly swollen and extremely painful, and there are strong indications that erysipelas has set in.
