COUNTY COURT

Interest in the Humiston Case.

There has been an unusual absence of familiar faces on street corners to-day owing to the opening of the Humiston case in which considerable interest centers. Many of the shops about town have been short of help as the hands were determined to take this occasion for a holiday that they might listen to the testimony in this case. District Attorney Clarence L. Smith is assisted in the prosecution by Judge G. L. Smith of Elmira, and Hon. Jerry McGuire appears for the defendant. The session this forenoon was a lively one the counsel on each side were exceedingly witty and sharp in their examination of witnesses and the crowd at the court room was simply immense.

The witnesses sworn this morning were James H. Tichenor, Hudson J. Wilson, Mary Dibble, Henry Shaw, Clarissa Robinson and Carrie Reed. Mary Dibble was twice on the witness stand. 

The following is the list of jurors in this case: Thomas M. Redding, Henry C. Sutliff, Theodore Sweazy, George Leonard, Gilbert S. Higgins, Colon J. Kirby, W. H. Canfield, Miles Metzgar, George Carman, Chas. H. Palmer, Hiram J. Sellen, Enos D. Wheeler.
