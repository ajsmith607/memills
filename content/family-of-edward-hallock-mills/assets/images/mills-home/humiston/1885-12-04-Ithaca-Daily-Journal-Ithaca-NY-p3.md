FOOT CRUSHED. 

Jasper Humiston, youngest son of H. N. Humiston, met with a serious and painful accident at about 4 P. M. yesterday which may result in the loss of his right foot. He had been engaged in loading a flat car with lumber at the G., I. & S. car shops at the Inlet, and was in the act of climbing on the rear end of a box car to which the loaded car was being coupled. Before the unfortunate young man could get out of reach of the loaded car, it was backed against the one he was climbing on, his right foot was caught between the “bumpers” and terribly crushed. 

He was taken at once to his home and a physician summoned. Every effort will be made to avoid amputation of the injured member. It is believed that with good care and treatment the foot may be saved.

About two years ago Mr. Humiston, who is a slater by trade, fell from the roof of the Inlet mission house while engaged in slating, fracturing his jaw and otherwise severely injuring himself. As his capital is his daily wages and in view of the fact that he has a wife and three small children dependent upon him for support, his case is truly an unfortunate one and deserving of the sympathy of the community.
