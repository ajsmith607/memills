COUNTY COURT.

HUMISTON MAKES AN EARNEST PLEA ON HIS OWN BEHALF

Sentenced to Rochester for One Year

This morning at least a half hour before court was called, a large number of people could be seen wending their way to the court house. Long before the opening all those faces that had become so familiar by constant attendance at the Humiston trial occupied the spectators' seats. Fifteen minutes before the opening, Humiston came in, proving that his recent visit to Elmira was not a trip to Canada, has many were trying to make out yesterday. Humiston had lost much of the bravado in manner for which he was noted. He walked into the ante room, hung up his hat, and with a much less confident manner than usual walked within the enclosure where he had been a conspicuous figure for four days, but now for the purpose of receiving sentence. Before court opened a letter was placed in Humiston's hand. His hand that was never known to tremble in court before shook visibly while he perused the letter. The court was called to order and Judge Lyon asked Humiston if he had anything to say why sentence should not be imposed upon him. Humiston arose and emphatically "yes." The judge gave him 

PERMISSION TO SPEAK.

Humiston, who looked as if at least five years had been added to this live since he was pronounced guilty on Wednesday, then addressed the court. He stated in the first place, that the charge against him was such, that he who had so often stood there should be the last one to be proved guilty of it. The jury had decided against him, yet few persons and God actually knew whether he was guilty or not. The decision had been made. He had no blame for the jury, had no hard feelings toward the court, nor for the district attorney. They had doubtless done what they thought right, and if it were not for courts, no rights could be respected. In this case the court had aimed to defend the right, but a chain of circumstances had brought him here. He stood not there as a criminal. From the time he came to Ithaca he had been no violator of law, he was not a gambler, a thief, or a violator of law; but in all his labors he had designed to preserve the law, and help out the ends of justice, and when he though of his labors for Ithaca in bringing criminals to justice ferreting out crime, this 

CRUSHING BLOW

to him became doubly crushing. Could he have had his choice, he would have rather been tried for murder; that could have have brought greater disgrace to his family then did this charge which had been brought against him. The sources of evidence against him had only been from lewd women, and they were not permitted to give the names of those who might have been used as evidence on his behalf. He asked for mercy of the court in recognition of his services in the detective business, which he affirmed was really what brought him there to-day. Some of the evidence brought against him, he said was circumstantial due, to means he was obliged to take, in bringing to light deeds of crime, in his business as detective. He then called to mind his

LABORS FOR LAW AND ORDER

"Do you remember," he said, my services when the burglars and incendiaries brought terror in Ithaca? Do you remember what I did as detective in the case of the barn burning of Col. Jos. Sprague, the barn of Warren King, the barn of Lafayette Treman, of Captain VanOrder, and Twist tavern barn. Remember Jesse Steven's store, which was burglarized and the two dwellings and a store which were burned; the store at Fall Creek which was burglarized and set fire to; Edwards' factory at Free Hollow, which was also burglarized. Then there was Northrup's shop at Varna, burglarized, Thos. Howell's store at Danby, which was robbed twice, and Nelson E. Lyon's store at Ludlowville, burglarized. In all these cases I procured the criminals and their conviction, as well as those who robbed the Nook hot houses. In addition, remember how a member of the noted Loomis gang was brought to justice by me for stealing a span of horses. I as employed to do this work by the Horse Owners Society at Dryden. Then a span of horses which were stolen at Troy, Pa., belonging to Mr. Putnam I found, but not the thief. Remember how members of the Personius family at Caroline, and other persons I brought to justice, for burglary, robbing corn cribs, houses and granaries, and stealing from barns fowls, harnesses, milk pans, etc., also the detection of those who did the shearing of the horses of Henry Quick, see of those evil doers, I detected and convicted. My hard labors brought about those results where others had entirely failed and peace and order were brought about within our borders." Mr. Humiston went on to say that to detect those criminals he was obliged to come in contact with the worst element of society, and this would explain why from time to time he had been in their presence. The charge that we was

"ROUGH IN MANNER"

might be true. None could do the work he had been doing for justice, laboring as he did among the class where he found clues to lost property and often the property itself, without becoming rough in manner. Yet no one could say that he ever hung around any place for the purpose of immorality. He never hung around saloons at the late hour of the night, to drink or gamble, yet for the work he had done, he had made enemies among the vicious, and now as a result of his work for justice, he stood condemned. The stories that the witnesses had told about him were basely false. Humiston then appealed for mercy of the court, in pity for his family. He had a wife dependent on him for support, his aged father and mother were in his care, and his mother even now was on her death bed. He appealed for the mercy of the court, in the name of his children and grandchildren who would suffer disgrace by his imprisonment. At this point

HUMISTON BROKE DOWN

and dropping into his chair wept violently for some time. After a few moments the judged asked Humiston if he had anything more to say. He then continued, "I will simply say this: I charge no blame to anyone. This is one of the misfortunes which a conspiracy sometimes brings to a man. It is the result of a conspiracy grown out of malice. Even the evidence was contradictory and the verdict was a surprise to me as it was to many others. I came here in 1856 with my little family and they have grown up respectable. I may have been rough, but I have never been a stirrer up of strife, but rather a promoter of justice. My services were sought by the people. I labored for them; my labors were crowned with success, and no citizen or client can say that I was not faithful to the charges placed in my hand. In all my business transactions I have paid a hundred cents on the dollar." With another appeal for mercy of the court, Humiston took his seat. After about ten minutes' deliberation, the judge returning to the court room, after an impressive address to the prisoner, sentenced him to one year's imprisonment in Monroe County Penitentiary. A letter was then read from Mr. McGuire, who was absent in New York, asking for a stay in proceedings. The judge stated that he saw no reason at that time for granting such stay of proceedings and the court adjourned until 4 o'clock this afternoon, when the judge promised that he would give his decision. The prisoner was then placed in the hands of the sheriff.
