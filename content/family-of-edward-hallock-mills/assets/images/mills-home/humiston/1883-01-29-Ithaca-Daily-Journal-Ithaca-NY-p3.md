SLATERS TAKE A TUMBLE

Two Sustain Painful Injuries.

Jeff. Humiston, John Blackman and Ed Porter were at work slating the roof of the Inlet mission chapel this morning, when their scaffold gave way. Humiston and Blackman fell to the ground–a distance of eighteen or twenty feet, each sustaining severe injuries, Humiston’s jaw being fractured, his shoulder and side sorely bruised and one hand disabled, while Blackman had one arm broken at the wrist and the other contused at the wrist and broken at the elbow. Porter was fortunate enough to drive his pointed hammer into the roof when he felt the scaffold slip and in this manner saved himself from his companion’s fate. The injured men were taken to the office of Drs. White & Kirkendall, where their wounds were dressed by Drs. Kirkendall and Barney.

Blackman is very badly injured and may be disabled for life, but it is hoped that he will come out all right. He is a powerfully built man with splendid muscular development.
