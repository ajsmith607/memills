A CIVIL DAMAGE SUIT. 

A JUDGMENT RENDERED AGAINST THE LANDLADY OF REED'S INN. 

The matter of Judy English against Julia Reed, hitherto alluded to in the JOURNAL, was tried at Slaterville yesterday before a jury and resulted in a victory for the plaintiff. 

The case as presented by the counsel, Abel Lott and H. N, Humiston, is this: Some time during last winter the husband of Judy English came to Ithaca and visited the inn kept by Mrs. Reed. Here he drank and got drunk. He was arrested and fined. The wife swore that paying the fine entailed distress up on herself and family. A large number of witnesses were sworn by the plaintiff but the defense did not present a single witness or cross examine either of those on the opposite side, The widow Reed was represented by attorneys Kline and Hungerford. The trial began at one P. M. and occupied the entire afternoon and part of the evening. The case was given to the jury after dark and they were out until half past one in the morning when they returned with a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, and a judgment of $87.50 with costs was rendered. Considerable interest has been manifested in the case and its progress in the higher courts whither it will be carried will be closely watched.
