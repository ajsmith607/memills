DOMESTIC INFELICITY. 

Elderly Woman Charges Husband with Non-Support.

After nearly two score years of married life, and the bringing up of a family of children, the relations between Mr. and Mrs. Ira Middaugh have become so strained that the wife yesterday had her husband arrested upon a complaint of non-support. It is unusual that persons as old as this couple, both of whom have passed sixty, come into polite court under non-support proceedings.

According to the woman, Mr. Middaugh left her more than six months ago and has since been living on a farm in Brookton, where he is employed. She claims that he also draws a pension, but that none of his money goes for the support of herself or her family. Middangh was placed under arrest yesterday afternoon and his trial was set down for 3 oâ€™clook this afternoon. 

To the police Middaugh stated that his domestic relations had never been pleasant. He said he never enjoyed the right of being master of his household and that he was not welcomed at home unless he was plentifully supplied with money. The sympathies of the police are with the man.
