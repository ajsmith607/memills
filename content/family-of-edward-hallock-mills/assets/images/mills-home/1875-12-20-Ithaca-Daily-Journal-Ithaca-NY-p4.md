  - "Laudanum is a tincture of opium containing approximately 10% powdered opium by weight (the equivalent of 1% morphine). Reddish-brown in color and extremely bitter, laudanum contains several opium alkaloids, including morphine and codeine. Laudanum was historically used to treat a variety of conditions, but its principal use was as a pain medication and cough suppressant. By the 19th century, laudanum was used in many patent medicines to "relieve pain ... to produce sleep ... to allay irritation ... to check excessive secretions ... to support the system ... [and] as a soporific". The limited pharmacopoeia of the day meant that opium derivatives were among the most effective of available treatments, so laudanum was widely prescribed for ailments from colds to meningitis to cardiac diseases, in both adults and children. Laudanum was used during the yellow fever epidemic. Innumerable Victorian women were prescribed the drug for relief of menstrual cramps and vague aches. Nurses also spoon-fed laudanum to infants. The Romantic and Victorian eras were marked by the widespread use of laudanum in Europe and the United States. Mary Todd Lincoln, for example, the wife of the US president Abraham Lincoln, was a laudanum addict, as was the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who was famously interrupted in the middle of an opium-induced writing session of Kubla Khan by a "person from Porlock". Initially a working class drug, laudanum was cheaper than a bottle of gin or wine, because it was treated as a medication for legal purposes and not taxed as an alcoholic beverage. Suicide by laudanum was not uncommon in the mid-19th century." ([Laudanum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laudanum), Wikipedia.org.) 

  - "A garret is a habitable attic, a living space at the top of a house or larger residential building, traditionally, small, dismal, and cramped, with sloping ceilings. In the days before elevators this was the least prestigious position in a building, at the very top of the stairs." ([Garret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garret), Wikipedia.org.)

SUICIDE AT MOTT'S CORNERS. 

Mrs. M. E. Personius Drowns Herself in a Mill Race. 

Mrs. M. E. Personius, wife of Charles W. Personius, of Mott’s Corners, committed suicide by drowning on Saturday afternoon last. The body was found in the mill race back of her house floating upon the face in less than two feet of water. She had removed her shoes and stockings and tied a rope to a tree and around her body so that she might not float away. These facts go to show that her self-destruction was premeditated. Coroner Brown was sent.for; he went up Saturday night, and held an inquest yesterday morning. The evidence given showed that deceased was deranged and had been for over a year, as she had previously attempted self destruction by poison, but had been frustrated. Mrs. Personius’ age was 27 years and 3 months. Her funeral was held to-day (Monday) at 2 o'clock. We append an abstract of the testimony taken before the Coroner’s jury, which consisted of Cornelius Johnson, Simon Sawyer, Ch’s. W. Burt, Martin Besemer, W. Harrison Shurter, Geo. B. Vandemark, William Vandemark and Willis Shurter: 

Charles W. Personius sworn—Am the husband of the deceased, Marshy E. Personius; occupation a miller; came to the House between 5 and 6 o'clock Saturday evening; found no one in the house; searched it without finding my wife; went to Wm. Wolcott’s and inquired for her her, also to Almanzo Perry’s; neither had seen her; Mr. Perry came home with me to search for her; we went through the house again, and then went back to the mill race, when we found her lying in the water directly back of the house, about twenty rods from the mill. The water was from 18 inches to two feet in depth; the body was floating on the water held up by a rope, tied about her waist and fastened to a tree; I took hold of the rope and tried to pull her out but could not because the rope interfered; so I cut it and Mr. Perry and I pulled her out; then Mr. Bacon assisted in getting her into the house; our cries for help had attracted the attention of several neighbors, who came to the house; as my wife was found to be dead the coroner was sent for; there were no marks of violence on the body; I believe she committed suicide; have had fears since the early part of summer that she was not in her right mind, from remarks that she made and from her actions; she stated to me several times that she did not wish to live; said she "wished she was dead;" never heard her say so before this summer; she has opposed me in almost everything I have attempted or proposed for the last three or four months; this was one reason why I thought her insane; never became angry with her or opposed her, during these spells, knowing her condition; we have always lived happily during our married life until her derangement since which time my anxiety for her has greatly marred my happiness; on the 11th of October last she attempted suicide by taking laudanum; I found her in the garret in a stupor; two empty laudanum bottles were lying by her and an ounce bottle of belladonna, three fourths full; I endeavored to arouse her and after a time she informed me she had taken laudanum, and said it was all right; I assisted her down stairs; placed her in bed and sent for Dr. Besemer; it was about 12 o’clock at night; I had worked in the mill till 10 o'clock, and when I came home supposed my wife had called at some of the neighbors to await my return from the mill; sat down and read the newspaper an hour; then became drowsy and went, to bed, but did not intend to go to sleep until she returned; but 1 did fall asleep and awoke in about an hour, when I was frightened at her continued absence; got up and searched the house, finding her as above stated. She was not in the habit of staying out late, but on this particular occasion she had asked me how late I was going to be in the mill; told her I did not know; at that time of year I was in the habit of grinding until 11 or 12
o'clock; So I supposed she was was for my accustomed time to return. My wife’s health has been poor a year and a half; about 7 years ago she gave birth to a deformed child which lived ten months; in April, 1874, we took from the Orphan’s Home in Elmira, a crippled child 12 or 13 months old; we became much attached to it, but after 7 or 8 months, my wife’s health failing, she took the child back to the home; cannot say whether this was one cause of her insanity or not; she said the care of the child and her household duties were too much for her strength; my wife has a cousin living who is now deranged. 

Mr. Almanzo A. Perry and Dr. Besemer gave testimony corroborating that of Mr. Personius.
