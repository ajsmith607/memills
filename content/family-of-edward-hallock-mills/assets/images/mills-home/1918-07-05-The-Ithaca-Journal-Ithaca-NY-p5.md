EARL WOLCOTT HELD SERGEANT’S COMMISSION 

Friends of the late Earl Wolcott, the first Tompkins County man to die in France from wounds, have informed The Journal that at the time of his death Mr. Wolcott was a sergeant, not a private as first reported. The Journal’s informant who supplied the data with reference to Sergeant Wolcott’s death did not learn until recently that before leaving America for France last fall Wolcott had been promoted to a corporal and that he became sergeant while on his way overseas. 

Sergeant Wolcott, who was serving in an infantry regiment, was severely burned by gas May 3 and died in a base hospital May 13. Before enlisting in the army, over two years ago he had served four years in the navy having gone around the world with the fleet in 1905.
