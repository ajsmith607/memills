DIED.

…VANDEMARK—In Mott’s Corners, Monday, Dec. 15th, Jacob Vandemark, aged 71 years.

Mr. Vandemark has long been known in this vicinity as a man of unflinching integrity, and those who were more intimately acquainted with him loved and honored him for his kindness of heart and christian sympathy. 

The poor will miss him, his neighbors will cherish his memory with tender regard, while the members of his own family will long mourn for him as the faithful guardian of their prosperity and happiness.— [Com.
