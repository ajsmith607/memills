DEATH OF CAMERON VORHIS. 

Mr. A. C. Vorhis, formerly a well known resident of Spencer, died at his home in Brookton Monday evening of a complication of diseases from which he had been suffering for nearly two years. Mr. Vorhis was born on the old Vorhis homestead at North Spencer about sixty-four years ago, and resided there the greater portion of his life, being engaged in dairying and farming, and for about four years he was engaged in the grain and produce business in this place. Some ten years ago, having purchased the Personius Flouring Mills at Brookton, he sold his North Spencer farm and removed to Brookton, where he has since resided, and where he built up a large business, from which business, however, he was compelled to retire a year or two ago on account of ill health, he being then succeeded by his two younger sons under the firm name of F. C. & E. F. Vorhis Ha died possessed of considerable property, including a half interest in a large grain farm in North Dakota. A widow and seven children survive him. 

Mr. V. was a man of strict integrity, enjoying the confidence and respect of all his business associates and a wide circle of friends. The remains were brought to North Spencer yesterday for interment at the old family burial place, and the funeral services were held at the North Spencer church at 12 o'clock, Rev. A. B. Woodworth, of Brookton, officiating, assisted by Rev. A. Livermore of this place. â€”Spencer Needle.
