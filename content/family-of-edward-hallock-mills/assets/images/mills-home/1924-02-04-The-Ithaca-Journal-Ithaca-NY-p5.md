The Reverend was killed when "a former mental patient, walked out of the building and fired at the Rev. Pinkney, who was standing waiting for a bus. Shotgun pellets struck the Rev. Pinkney in the abdomen, eye and leg." (07 Jan 1960, Wilmington News-Journal, Wilmington OH, p1.) The Reverend died the following day after enduring five hours of surgery.
