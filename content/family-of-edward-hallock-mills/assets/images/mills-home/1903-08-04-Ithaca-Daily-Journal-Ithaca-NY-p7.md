BROOKTON. 

Miss Any Munson is visiting friends in Rochester. 

Born, July 22, to Mr. and Mrs. Hiram McAvoy, a son. 

Mrs. Samuel Woodhull has been in Trumansburg for some time past visiting her daughter. 

Mr. and Mrs. Leroy Trapp, of McLean, were recent guests of her parents, Mr. and Mrs. George R. Peck. 

Robert M. Abbott has returned to his home in Binghamton, after spending a week here with his cousin, Mrs. R. L. Denman. 

Philip Kisor is entertaining his niece, Mrs. Flora Johnson, nee Auchmoody, and his sister, Mrs. Butler, both of Minnesota. 

Mr. and Mrs, Lee Brown, formerly of Ithaca, are now residents of this place. Mr. B. is in the employ of Edward Lounsbery, and occupies one of his houses. He was atone time president of the George Junior Republic. 

A number of Brookton residents are seriously inconvenienced by the alleged clearing up of the Six Mile Creek watershed by the Ithaca Board of Health. We doubt if the law will uphold that department in their arbitrary demands.  

The Caroline Telephone Company has its line in operation, and several of the farmers in this vicinity have phones in their residences. With the rural free delivery, telephone, and traveling grocers, farmers have little or no occasion to leave home except for recreation.
