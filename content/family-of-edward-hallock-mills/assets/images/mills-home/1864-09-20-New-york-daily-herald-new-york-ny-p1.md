PERSONAL. 

The army has lost a brave officer by the death of Col. David Ireland, commanding the Third brigade, Second division, Twentieth corps. His illness was short, and he had never sufficiently recovered the effects of a wound received at Ressacca. A native of Scotland, he got command of the One Hundred and Thirty-seventh New York, raised at Binghamton, New York, and came out in the two years service. 

He distinguished himself at the battles of Wohachee, Lookout Mountain, Mission Ridge, and served ail through this campaign, and was wounded at Ressacca, where his brigade captured and planted their flag on the enemy's batteries and captured four guns. He soon after resumed command, served all through the campaigns, and died just as his brigade had helped to raise the Stars and Stripes over Atlanta. 

Though General Geary has suffered heavily in officers and men—for not one of his old officers now remains on his staff, all of them having been either killed or invalided—he has now lost his right hand, and the country a brave soldier in Colonel David Ireland.
