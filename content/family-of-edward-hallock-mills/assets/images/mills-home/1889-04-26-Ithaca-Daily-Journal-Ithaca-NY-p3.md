BROOKTON. 

A number from here attended Easter services in Ithaca last Sunday. 

The Ladies’ Aid Society of the Baptist church will give a Washington party at the rink next Tuesday evening, April 30. 

Cameron Vorhis was taken seriously ill last Saturday morning. He is attended by Dr. Besemer and is now considerably improved. 

Flora Auchmoody was married in Ithaca, Tuesday, to a Mr. Johnson of Dakota. They will leave for their western home this week. 

Rev. Mr. Underhill, formerly assistant pastor of the State street church, Ithaca, and now of West Newton, was visiting at Moses Hurlbut’s last week. 

Officer Norton in town Monday and arrested some of our young men, who created a disturbance in Ithaca Saturday night while intoxicated. The went down Tuesday for examination.

The bell formerly in the Dutch Reformed church at Boiceville was purchased by W. V. and Charles Personius for the Congregational church here and is now being put in place. There will now be no excuse for people coming late to church.

A large company were invited to the pleasant home of Mr. and Mrs. George E. Sanders, last Thursday evening, to enjoy a progressive euchre party. All present were highly entertained, the only accident of the evening being the escape of the booby before the sentence could be executed.

The trustees of the Congregational church have secured the services of Mrs. S. E. Eastman for the next three months. Those who have heard her preach the past two Sundays need not be told that the people of this vicinity will enjoy listening to her. She especially requests that the people will try and be in their seats promptly on time, 11 A. M. and 7:30 P. M., in order that the services may not be disturbed.
