  - Sydney Post, No. 41, Grand Army of the Republic, in Ithaca NY, was named in honor of [Lieutenant Joseph W. Sydney](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/47075151/joseph-w-sydney) (22 Mar 1840 to 31 Oct 1864). “At the age of twenty-one, young Sydney entered the regular service as an assistant engineer in the Navy. He served faithfully and well for three years and was rising rapidly in his chosen profession, when disease and death overtook him at his post of duty, Oct. 31st, 1864, in the 24th year of his age. In the Ithaca Journal and Advertiser of Dec. 7, 1864, we find the following notice: “Died—On board of the U.S. Steamer “Pembina” off Brazos Island, Texas, on the 31st of October last, Asst. Engineer Joseph W. Sydney, U.S.N., only son of Edwin Syndey, Esq., of this village, aged 24 years.” The Post is said to be "newly formed" in Ithaca on Memorial Day in 1877, when a special ceremony was held by the Sydney Post at Joseph’s grave. (31 May 1877, Ithaca Daily Journal, Ithaca NY, p3.) The New York, U.S., Town Clerks' Registers of Men Who Served in the Civil War, ca 1861-1865, indicates that Joseph was originally buried at Brazos, and according to his findagrave entry, his body was "returned to Ithaca and buried 24 Jan 1866".

  - "Marching Through Georgia" (sometimes spelled as "Marching Thru' Georgia" or "Marching Thro Georgia") is a marching song written by Henry Clay Work at the end of the American Civil War in 1865. The title and lyrics of the song refer to U.S. Army major general William T. Sherman's "March to the Sea" to capture the Confederate city of Savannah, Georgia in late 1864. The song became widely popular with Union Army veterans after the American Civil War. The song, sung from the point of view of a Union soldier, tells of marching through Georgian territory, freeing slaves, meeting Southern Unionist men glad to once again see the U.S. flag, and punishing the Confederacy for their starting the war." ([Marching Through Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_Through_Georgia), Wikipedia.org.) The first verse of Marching Through Georgia:

    > Bring the good old bugle, boys
    >
    > We’ll sing another song
    >
    > Sing it with a spirit that will
    >
    > Start the world along
    >
    > Sing it as we used to sing it
    >
    > Fifty thousand strong
    >
    > While we were marching through Georgia 

  - "The Autophone was an early type of organette, invented in 1878 by Henry Bishop Horton. One of the first table-top organettes to be mass-produced, it played music using punched cards to activate 22 reeds." [...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organette) "The Organette was a mechanical free-reed programmable (automatic) musical instrument first manufactured in the late 1870s by several companies such as John McTammany of Cambridge, Massachusetts, **the Autophone Company of Ithaca, New York**, the Automatic Organ Co of Boston, Massachusetts, E.P. Needham & Sons of New York City, J.M. Draper of Blackburn, England, Paul Ehrlich & Co. of Leipzig, Germany, and The Mechanical Orguinette Co. of New York, NY as well as other manufacturers worldwide. The organette (or orguinette) used rolls of perforated paper, perforated cardboard, perforated metal disks and wooden rollers (or "cobs") on which the music was programmed. Musical scales ranged from 14 to 39 notes depending on the instrument's complexity. Air pressure or vacuum was produced by hand-, crank- or foot-operated mechanical bellows. The organette was compact and affordable with large selections of music available. **Various patents credit Henry Bishop Horton (1819-1885; co-founder of the Ithaca Calendar Clock Co),** John McTammany (1845-1915), Paul Ehrlich and others with inventing the organette. The organette's popularity declined as the phonograph was introduced and became more affordable." ([Autophone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophone), Wikipedia.org. Emphasis added.)

OLD SOLDIERS’ MEETING. 

THE VETS IN COUNCIL AT MOTT’S CORNERS.  

The notice published in the JOURNAL of April 22, for a camp fire to be held at Lounsbery’s Hall, Motts’s Corners, brought out about thirty old veterans of the Town of Caroline and vicinity last Saturday evening. The meeting was called to order by Capt. W. V. Personius, and B. T. Landon was called to the chair. Capt. Lounsbery then stated that the object of the meeting was to organize a Post of the Grand Army of the Republic, whereupon twenty four comrades signed the roll and a Post will be organized next Saturday evening, providing a charter can be obtained from Department Headquarters in time. About this time several comrades from Sydney Post, of Ithaca, put in an appearance, when the boys gave themselves up to a general good time. 

Comrade Joe Lindsley, introduced one of Hibbard’s autophones and played some very sweet music, after which the boys joined in singing "Marching through Georgia." Rations were now announced to which the boys all did ample justice. After the pork-and beans had been demolished, the boys returned to the hall, where a rattling fire of songs, stories and reminiscences were kept up until 12 o’clock, when the camp broke up, every comrade present, however, feeling that he had had a good time. 

A cordial invitation is extended to all honorably discharged soldiers and sailors in the vicinity of Mott’s Corners: to send in their names and discharge papers next Saturday evening, and join in establishing a Post of G.A.R.
