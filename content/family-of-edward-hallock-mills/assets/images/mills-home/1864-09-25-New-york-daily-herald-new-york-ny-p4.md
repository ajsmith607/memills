Obituary.

COLONEL DAVID IRELAND. 

In the recent death of Colonel David Ireland the army has lost the services of an able and devoted officer, and one whose place in his regiment it will be hard to fill. Entering the service at the time of the first call for troops, in the spring of 1861, he participated in the first battle of Bull run, as Adjutant of the Seventy-ninth regiment New York State Militia (Highland Guard). He was distinguished on that memorable field for coolness and bravery, receiving the commendations of his superior officers, including his division commander. He was promoted to a captaincy in the Fifteenth regiment regular infantry in August, 1861, and served about one year with his regiment, gaining many friends by his frank and genial manners and untiring devotion to his duties. In the summer of 1862 be received a leave of absence from his regiment during the war, to enable him to accept the colonelcy of the One Hundred and Thirty-seventh regiment New York Volunteers. He handled his regiment with the same skill and ease that he did a company, and brought them to a high standard of drill and efficiency. The steadiness and determination which enabled his command to storm successfully the rebel stronghold at Ressacca, under a most galling fire, were due to his rigid discipline and instruction. It was here that he received the wound which terminated in his death, after a short illness. His desire to personally command his men led him to the field before he was fit for duty, and thus he contracted the disease which closed his career. The country and the cause sustain a great loss by his untimely death.
