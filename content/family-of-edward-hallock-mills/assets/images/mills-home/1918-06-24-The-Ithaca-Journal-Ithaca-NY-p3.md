Private Earl Wolcott Dies From Gas Wound 

First Tompkins County Boy to Give His Life in Actual Fighting Against Germans Succumbs in Hospital May 13 — Went Over in First Division With General Pershing  

The first Tompkins County man to give his life for his country on the field of battle was Earl A. Wolcott who died in a hospital behind the lines on May, 13 last from injuries received from a German gas shell on May 3. The tidings came in a letter from a comrade who finding among Private Wolcott’s effects the address of a girl friend now living in Groton, sent her the news of Private Wolcott’s death. Private Wolcott who was 26 years of age and whose only near kinfolks live in Brookton, went to France last May with General Pershing in the First Regular Division. 

It was not the first time that he had served his country in the military service. Before joining the army in 1915 he had a record of four years’ service in the navy. 

While he was in the navy Private Wolcott went around the world with the fleet sent on a world cruise by President Roosevelt. When he returned here he told many interesting tales of his experiences and the time spent in China and Japan. 

Private Wolcott was a bookbinder and was employed by J. Will Tree for several years, until war was declared against Germany, when he enlisted, choosing the infantry instead of the navy. One of the last statements he made before he left Ithaca was to the effect that if he didn’t get the Kaiser, he would die trying. 

It is surmised that Private Wolcott received the mortal injury which ended his life—he was seriously burned by a gas shell—at Cantigny, the village which the First Division wrested from the Germans several weeks ago. 

A week ago when news came that Private Charles E. Dempsey of Trumansburg was wounded on June 7 on the Marne it was thought that he was the first Tompkins County boy to be named by the casualty lists as wounded in France. And so he was, but only because Private Wolcott’s name was somehow omitted. It now develops that he sustained his mortal wound a full month earlier. 

The letter from Private Wolcott's comrade announcing his death follows: 

“Base Hospital, May 18, 1918. “Miss Theo Stevens— 

“As a personal friend of Mr. Earl A. Wolcott I feel it my duty to inform you of his death, which came the 13th of this month. His death is a great shock to me and many other of his company. I have soldiered with him since December, 1915, on the Mexican border and here in France and found him to be true to his word, upright and manly in every respect. His death was caused by gas. Will you please inform his grandmother—Mrs. Aldrich, I believe, is her name. 

“With all respect to you and Earl’s friends, 

“I am, 

“A FRIEND.” 

The name of this “friend,” as appeared from the envelope was Private W. E. Wyatt, and it was doubtless he who furnished the address to a Red Cross nurse, whose touching account of Private Wolcott’s last hours was received a day or two later. It follows: 

**Nurse’s Letter**

“Somewhere in France, 1918.” 

“My dear Miss Stevens— 

“One of the men in Mr. Wolcott’s regiment knew he has been writing you since he has been in France, and, as we cannot find his grandmother’s address, I am writing to tell you of his death and to ask you to write her if possible. 

“He was seriously burned by a gas shell May 3, and was in a field hospital until Friday, May 11, when he was brought here. He developed pneumonia and died Sunday evening about 7 o’clock. He was pretty delirious most of the time he was here, but had moments of being rational. I was with him almost up to the last moment of this life and he told me he would give anything if he could go home. He said that several times, so I expect he died thinking of you people at home he cared about. 

“This is a French hospital, but there are three of us American Red Cross nurses to take care of the American boys. It is awfully hard to see them suffer, but it’s great to be able to help them even a little. We had a military funeral for Mr. Wolcott and our boys marched to the grave. It was very impressive. The service was read in English by an A. R. C. (American Red Cross) chaplain, and meant much to all of us. 

“I don’t know what he was to you, but he was a good friend anyhow, I am sure, and you will know without my telling you that he was brave and patient up to the very last, and the men in his regiment felt terrible to have him go. He seems to have had many friends among them. If you know his grandmother’s address and will write her this, we would appreciate it very much. 

“With warmest sympathy to her and to you, believe me, 

“Very sincerely yours, 

“MARY P. M’CANDLISH.” 

The grandmother whose address was thus sought in vain, but to whom the sad news was promptly forwarded by the recipient of these letters is his father’s mother, Mrs. George Aldrich, of Brookton, formerly Mrs. Wolcott, who brought Earl up from babyhood. 

Born in California, he was orphaned by the death of his mother, and soon his father also was drowned off the California coast. A brother, George Fred Wolcott, and a grandfather; John Roe, both of Brookton, are his only other near kin in this country. 

His grandfather Wolcott was a veteran of the Civil War, and the boy’s enthusiasms were always for soldiering. At 16 he enlisted in the navy and served till he was 20. Then for four years he settled down at Ithaca as a bookbinder in the employ of J. Will Tree, long making his home with the family of Elmer E. Stevens, whose daughter is the correspondent named above. 

But the impulse to adventure was too strong in him, and after a summer in boat service on the Great Lakes he in October of 1915 enlisted in the regular army and spent the next two years on the Mexican border, till in May of 1917, with General Pershing he sailed for France. Readers of The Journal will not have forgotten the cheery Christmas greeting from him which was published in the issue of January 3d, or the gay letter of mid-February printed on March 13, in which he told of his experiences in the trenches. Already before the fatal injury he had twice been wounded in the shoulder, and twice disabled by gas. 

And now at 27, he is gone. “True to his word,” “upright and manly,” “brave and patient to the last.” What soldier could ask better epitaph? “No bigger-hearted boy," says Mr. Tree, his old employer, “ever lived on earth.”
