Jones Wins Study Grant 

C. Dalton Jones of Brooktondale, a research associate in psychology at Cornell also associated with Cornell's Africana Studies Center, has won a $7,425 grant from the Carnegie Corp., the corporation has announced. 

Jones will plan a study of the ways children learn and solve problems in their home environments. His theory is that black children develop learning strategies based on their experiences, while most schools approach skill development through explicit verbal rules that are successful mostly with white, middle-class children.
