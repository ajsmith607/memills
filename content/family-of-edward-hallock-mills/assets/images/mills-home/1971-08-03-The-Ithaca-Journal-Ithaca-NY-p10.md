Criticized 

Editor, The Journal: 

While I am sympathetic to the recent decision by the Tompkins County Hospital Board of Managers to allow “fathers in the delivery room during childbirth” (Ithaca Journal, 7-27-71), it seems to me that the move is basically an unrealistic and a discriminatory one. 

The decision seems unrealistic because nowhere do its advocates discuss its implications — that this commitment to support a “couple's” desire to share the event of childbirth together is really a commitment to make the experience as natural as possible for the mother-to-be, a further assumption being that her emotional status may significantly affect the quality of her mothering and subsequent family relations. 

Furthermore, allowing “fathers” into the delivery room is really a commitment to make the hospital experience an extension of the woman's natural routine whereby non-medical personnel are allowed to assist the woman because childbirth is now admitted to be not solely a medical phenomenon. The decision by the Board of Managers, then, is actually a decision to dignify the human circumstances into which a child is born and to respect the woman's assessment of her own emotional requisites during childbirth, 

Since we must assume that all persons involved with the recent ruling are committed to all babies and all women likely to be served by Tompkins County Hospital, rather than a few, it is unfortunate that the previous prohibition of fathers in the delivery room will prove more just, because it applied to everyone, than the present ruling. Are all pregnant women served by the hospital married? Would all of those that are married choose to share labor and childbirth with their husbands? 

As the present decision is written, only those women who are married to men with whom they share a supportive relationship have any choice in this matter and unless we are to answer the above questions affirmatively then the ruling “allowing fathers in the delivery room during childbirth” discriminates against unmarried women and unsatisfactorily married women. 

Furthermore, if it is the case that a woman's emotional well-being during childbirth might affect her performance as a mother and that allowing her to be assisted by a loved one during this experience might positively influence her behavior, then not only many women, but their babies, too, will be deprived of a significant service offered by Tompkins Co. Hosp.
