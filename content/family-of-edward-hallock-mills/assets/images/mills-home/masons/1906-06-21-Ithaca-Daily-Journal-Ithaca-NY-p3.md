ALONZO B. NORTHRUP

The death of Alonzo B. Northrup at the advanced age of eighty-five years, occurred yesterday afternoon at three o'clock at the home of his daughter, Mrs. Willard Mowry, 522 North Albany street. Mr. Northrup was born on ship board in the Atlantic ocean. His parents came from Newton, England, and settled in Bethel, Connecticut.

About sixty-five years ago Mr. Northrup came to New York state and lived in different places in this county. He was a stone mason by trade. He married Miss Clarissa Personius, whom he survived some years. He had resided in this city for about twenty years. He was a member of the Congregational Church of Brooklyn.

The surviving relatives are two sons, Charles D. Northrup of Etna, James H. Northrup of this city, two daughters, Mrs. Willard Mowry and Mrs. Rachel Granger, both of Ithaca; two sisters living in Bethel, nine grand-children and three great-grand-children. The funeral will be held tomorrow morning at ten o'clock, Rev. E. A. George officiating, and interment will be in the Quick cemetery at Brookton.
