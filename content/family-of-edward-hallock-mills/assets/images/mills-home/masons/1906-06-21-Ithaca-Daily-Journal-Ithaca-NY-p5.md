OCTOGENARIANS' MORTUARY RECORD.

Six Old Residents Combined Ages Five Centuries.

Alonzo B. Northrup and Mrs. Almira Norton, whose deaths occurred yesterday, had lived a combined period of 170 years. It was a singular coincidence that their initials, A. N., were the same and they were each born in December 1821, besides dying on the same day.

Six octogenarians have passed away during the past three weeks, who have been long residents of the city of Ithaca. The six persons referred to lived an aggregate of 503 years. They were Fanny K. Massey, aged 86; Sarah Stephens, aged 84; John M. Cratlsey, aged 88, Eliza Vail, aged 85, Almira Norton, aged 85, Alonzo B. Northrup, aged 85.
