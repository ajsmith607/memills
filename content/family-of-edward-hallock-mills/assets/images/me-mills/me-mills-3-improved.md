citation: "Molly Adams Collection, Caroline History Room, Slaterville NY."
notes: >-

  - The card also contains the text: "Peerless Printing Co., Penn Yan, N. Y." above the illustration, and the number "959" below the illustration. 

  - Based on its inferred size and relative proportions, as well as the "friendly greeting", this is likely a postcard that Emily apparently gave away to customers to advertise her store. I did not find a reproduction of the opposite side.
