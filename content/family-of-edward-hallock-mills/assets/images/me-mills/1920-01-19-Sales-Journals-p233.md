    These entries show good examples of Emily's distinctive writing style. Notice the little dip that starts the top cross marks on her F's and T's. Uppercase C's, E's and M's are also easily recognizable, as are the lower case p's which have a dramatic upward flourish. You can almost imagine her confident and efficiently crisp pen strokes as she stands behind the counter of her store, attention focused on this page.
