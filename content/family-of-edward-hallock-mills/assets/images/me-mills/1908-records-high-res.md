    Notes:

    - This page is the inside back cover of volume 41 of the Mills' store sales journals show the store's business expenses in the final days of E. H. Mills and the transition after Edward's death to M. E. Mills. These books are hardcover, cloth.

    - While typical sales are entered in the books as you would expect, the family account records start in the back and are filled in toward the front.

    - The 22 Jan 1908 entry mentions Emily Hunting, who is likely [Emily Mills Huntting](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/23991552/emily-mills-huntting) (1849 to 1932). This indicates that Emily was still in contact with family in Long Island later in her life.

    - The 21 Jan 1908 entry appears to refer to services provided by Reverend Allen Beach Woodworth (1837-1910), who is also mentioned in Edward's obituary in the historical records of Caroline Valley Federated Church, reproduced elsewhere in this publication. The Reverend's obituary in the Ithaca Daily News (12 Sep 1910, p3) states he was the long-time pastor of the Brookton Baptist Church. This was a transition period between pastors for the Congregational Church, and in both the Ithaca Daily News and the historical records of Caroline Valley Federated Church, Reverend Woodworth is noted as performing Sunday services at the Congregational Church as well as officiating funerals for Congregation members during this time, presumably helping out in his retirement. Church records are vague on the point, but its quite likely he helped out irregularly over many months as the Congregational Church needed his services. The writing is a little unclear, but also considering the fact that she did not use the title "Reverend" suggests that perhaps the fee for the Reverend's services was being collected by his second wife Lorena, who was the same age as Emily. 

    - The 23 Jan 1908 entry is presumably a reference to Ellen Gould.
