–The happiest man here is Willis Shurter. We will not say why, but if any one could furnish him with a list of names suitable for a girl, he would probably receive thanks. She weighs six and one-half pounds.

–Another happy man is Fred Lounsbery, of the firm of Personius & Lounsbery. He has just taken to himself one of Caroline’s fair daughters. Congratulations are in order.
