On the Edge

Machinery dredges Six Mile Creek near the Brooktondale bridge. In the background is the former Brewer house, jacked up for moving. It has been purchased by Joseph Puryear, and will be relocated about a quarter of a mile north of the bridge. 

Rte. 330 Work Almost Completed. 

BROOKTONDALE — Reconstruction of Rte. 330 in the Town of Caroline will be done this week, almost nine months ahead of schedule, according to Paul Viau of Cortland, assistant to the project engineer. 

Work on the approximately five miles between Rte. 79 and Guideboard Corners began in July 1965. 

Viau said the final survey is under way. Banks have been seeded and straw-covered, although scattered spots will need reseeding, a job to be done this week and next. 

Two sub-contractors’ jobs of erecting guide rails and fences and planting 80 trees are expected to be finished in a week.
