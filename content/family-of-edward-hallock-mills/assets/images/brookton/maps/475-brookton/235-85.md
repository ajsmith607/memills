  - In the 1887 Dalebrook deed (Caroline Deeds 2, p510), the grist mill is described as it was originally "excepting and reserving herefrom the land heretofore conveyed by Jacob Vandemark and Charles W. Personius to Wm. B. Wolcott".

  - The highlighted description of the shared boundary with Mills' Home can be found in the Dalebrook deeds of 1920 (Deeds 198/201), 1934 (Deeds 235/85) and 1945 (Deeds 184/378) and would only change in 1972 (Deeds 499/981) based on the survey of 475 Brooktondale Road by Gordon Rice.
