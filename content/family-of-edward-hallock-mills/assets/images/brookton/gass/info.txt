Ara Lucy (Gass) Walsh Holland was the daughter of [Judge John W. Gass](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/128253884/john-w-gass) (1843 to 19 Jan 1900) and Rebecca (Richardson) Gass. Judge Gass was a Civil War veteran in the Thirteenth Illnois Calvary, and he was a member of the David Ireland Post of the Brookton G.A.R. As the result of a spinal wound received in the War, he was confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. He was an attorney, a former Justice of the Peace, and Loans Commissioner. The family moved to California by the early 1890's, and Ara continued to sing for church and community organizations into adulthood.
