Brookton Will Be Changed To Brooktondale 

A communication has been received from the United States Postoffice Department at Washington, D. C., authorizing a change of the name of the postoffice at Brookton to Brooktondale on February 16, 1926. 

This action was taken in response to the filing of a petition by the patrons of the Brookton postoffice praying for relief from the annoyance and loss due to a considerable proportion of mail matter as well as express and freight shipments, directed to Brookton being missent to Brockton. 

The project has been in progress for about 18 months and was materially furthered by the interested and kindly co-operation of Congressman Gale H. Stalker.
