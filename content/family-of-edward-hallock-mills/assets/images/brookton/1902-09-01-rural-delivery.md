60 The Towns of Tompkins County 

28. Rural Free Delivery leaving from the Brookton post office on September 1, 1902. Fred Lounsbery, postmaster, is seen in the post office doorway; the carriers are, left to right, Charlie Stanley, John Caveney, Walter VanDeMark, and DeForest McWhorter. Frank Mulks waits in the store doorway. Many rural post offices closed in 1902. When the Speedsville post office closed, mail was delivered there from Berkshire.
