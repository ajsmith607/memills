By BARBARA BELL Journal Staff Writer It is usually called a covered bridge, but a more thought-teasing nomenclature is “Kissing Bridge.” 

Tompkins County has had four of them. 

The lone survivor is in the Village of Newfield on Bridge St., between Main and Banks Sts. Others were at Halseyville, Speedsville, and Brooktondale. 

Of the latter, little is known. It probably was private property. 

There is a painting of the Brooktondale bridge, dated 1879 and titled ‘Big Bridge, Motts Corners.”’ It is signed by Mary Tobey and belongs to DeWitt Historical Society. William Heidt of Ithaca and other historians are seeking more information about it for Society records.
