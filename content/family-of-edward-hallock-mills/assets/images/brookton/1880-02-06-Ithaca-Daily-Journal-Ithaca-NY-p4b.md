AN UNEXPECTED WEDDING. 

Last evening at a social gathering, the 20th anniversary of the marriage Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Munson–there chanced to be a young lady and gentleman known to be engaged. The host having learned that they expected to be married within a few weeks, suggested that it would be a good plan to have the knot tied there and then. “I’m ready,” said the gentleman. “So am I.” said the lady. “Well, if that’s the case I'll send for the minister at once,” said Mr. Munson. In a few moments Presiding Elder Hard was on the spot and at halfpast nine o'clock on this brief notice Mr. Fred B. Lounsberry [sic] and Miss Emma Rarrick were made husband and wife, the ceremony being witnessed by a large and very merry company.
