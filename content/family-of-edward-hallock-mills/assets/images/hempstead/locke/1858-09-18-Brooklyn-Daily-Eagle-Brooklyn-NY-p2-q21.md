Bold Assault.—Miss Eliza Mersereau, of this village, was assaulted by a ruffian on last Sunday evening while on her way to church. When near Mrs. Platt’s the fellow jumped off the fence and ran against Miss M., knocking her down, when he tore off her shawl, and made a dash at her watch chain, but missed it. He then ran off. The shawl was lost, but the watch, which the fellow probably was in search of, was saved. Suspicion rests upon a German in the employ of Mr. Edward Nichols, who partly betrayed himself the same evening. He came home much excited and looking pale, told the family he had been much frightened by seeing two men knock a lady down near the Presbyterian Church. The next morning he took his trunk and left in the early train. There is but little doubt but this man was the offender. —Hempstead Enquirer.
