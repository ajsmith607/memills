OFFICE BUILDING TO REPLACE SITE OF OLD BORO CHURCH 

Six-Story Structure Planned for Willoughby St. Corner Leased to Building Firm. 

The steady advancement of the Boro Hall neighborhood of Willoughby st., as a prominent office center, indicated during the past year in the replacement of old landmarks with large modern business buildings and offices, is further emphasized in plans announced for an office structure for the site of the old church building at the northeast corner of Pearl and Willoughby sts. 

The improvement will result from a lease taken by the Pearl-Willoughby Corporation of the site from J. W. and W. H. Reid, Inc., for a long term at an aggregate rental of $500,000. The building, which will be six stories high, will cost close to $800,000. William Raymond Burling was the real estate broker for the landlords and Pierce W. Grace and Wollenberg & Son, for the tenants. Joseph Grodsky is is president of the Pearl-Willoughby Corporation. 

This property is a site of historic importance in old Brooklyn, the corner building having been built in 1838 as a place of worship for the First Congregational Church. A bronze plate, which was in the cornerstone of the church building, is in the possession of the owner of the property, and carries such well-known names as Samuel Augustus Willoughby, commonly known as Lord Willoughby, and who erected the church; the Rev. Henry P. Tappan, first pastor of the church; Martin Van Buren, President of the United States; William L. Marcy, Governor of the State of New York; Jeremiah Johnson, Mayor of the City of Brooklyn, and tells the very interesting fact that the population of Brooklyn in 1834 was 27,000. 

In 1845 the property was acquired from the church by Joseph Hegeman, who established the business which has been continuously transacted on the property from that time on. Some 35 years ago the property was acquired by William H. Reid, who has continued the business established over 80 years ago. 

Mr. Grodsky is one of Brooklyn’s pioneer builders. His successful operations, having covered over a period of 25 years, include the construction of several large buildings in the Boro Hall section. 

The existing building will be demolished in a short time and will be replaced with a building which will provide stores and offices of the most modern type and in keeping with the surroundings of the section. 

Deal Indicates Trend of Business. 

Mr. Burling, in speaking of this transaction, said, “This deal is a further indication of the business values which have come to Willoughby st. with the benefit of transit and its proximity to both the financial center at Boro Hall and the shopping center along Fulton st., whereby Willoughby st. combines throughout its length many of the valuable characteristics of both of these sections. 

Neighboring Structures. 

“With the development of the large office buildings of both the Brooklyn Edison Company across the street from this property, the Brooklyn Law School of 14 stories directly adjoining and the New York Telephone Company at Lawrence st., the development of Willoughby st. became assured. 

“This particular property is peculiarly well located in that it is only a short block either from Boro Hall or from Fulton st., through Pearl st., and by its location on the northeast corner it is clearly visible from both of these streets. 

“It is my opinion that with the building of the Jay st. subway these two short blocks on Willoughby st. are destined to become an integral part of the Boro Hall section.” 

The attorneys in the transaction were Maurice J. Moore for the landlord and Louis J. Moss for the tenants.
