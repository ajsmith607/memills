Presbyterian Church at Freeport. 

FOR THE SENTINEL.

Mr. Editor:— 

The new Presbyterian Church which has just been completed in Freeport was dedicated to the service of God, Wednesday last with appropriate services. — Rev. J. D. Wells of Brooklyn preached an excellent and timely sermon, from Gen. 28:17, “How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of Heaven,” The exercises were engaged in with deep interest by a large and attentive congregation, Rev. P. D. Oakey of Jamaica, and Rev. N. C. Locke D. D. of Hempstead, were present, and took part in the services. Rev. Jas. Prior also was present, together with several distinguished strangers from other places. 

After the sermon a statement was made of the pecuniary condition of the enterprise, slips of paper were distributed among the audience, and the friends were requested to put down their names with the suns they would give, when about $300 in pledges and money, were collected in a few minutes, One gentleman friend from Jamaica arose and said he would be one of twelve to pay off the whole balance. Are there not eleven others who will do likewise.— Another staunch friend of the little church put down his name for $100 without saying a word, though he resides in Brooklyn he is well-known and highly respected here by his oft-repeated noble deeds. 

Our people themselves have done nobly, some of them beyond their means, others have given largely of their own competence, and, I presume, will add to what they have given, rather than see a burdensome debt resting on the church, which they have positively declared must be free from encumbrance. When I see one man putting down $500 in addition to $200 which had been previously subscribed by him, [ believe he means to have his church clear. 

Our new building strikes those who have seen it for the first time as a little out of the usual and common style and yet ornate and beautiful. Some gentlemen from Brooklyn were delighted with it. It is an ornament to our place. I hope it will be more than that, a means of moral elevation and improvement— the audience room is very neat and convenient, and easy to speak in. It will seat about 350 by close stowing, Being warmed by a furnace from below, the eye is not offended by unsightly stove pipes, nor the ear with the rattling of stoves during service. And then we have a beautiful bell in the modest tower, which sounds forth its sweet and solemn tones over our quiet village, and out on the bay, calling us to the house of God and exciting in our hearts the reverent feeling of worship. This is the first church bell that has ever performed this holy Mission among this people and may its impressive calls be heard and obeyed. 

M. D. 

Freeport, April 7, 1860.
