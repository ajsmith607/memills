NICHOLS.

Edward Nichols died at his home about three miles south of Batavia on Friday morning, Feb. 22. He was the father of Mrs. H. R. Granger of Warsaw.

He was a member of the Presbyterian church and was an upright man, respected by all who knew him. He leaves five daughters and two sons to mourn his loss.

The funeral services were held at his late home Monday afternoon at 2 o'clock, Rev. W. J. McKittrick of Calvary church, Buffalo, his former pastor, officiating.
