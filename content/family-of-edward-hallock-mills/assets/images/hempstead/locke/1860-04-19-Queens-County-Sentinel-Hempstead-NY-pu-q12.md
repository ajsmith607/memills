Resignation.

We learn that the Rev. N. C. Locke of the Presbyterian Church in this village, on Sunday last tendered his resignation to his congregation which was by a vote of the congregation all but unanimously declined. This was subsequently reconsidered, and upon his own earnest request, on the representation of the state of his health was accepted as a matter of peremptory necessity, and personal favor.
