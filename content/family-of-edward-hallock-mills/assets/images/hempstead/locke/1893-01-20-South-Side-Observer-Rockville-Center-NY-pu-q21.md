HEMPSTEAD. 

The need of more room for its accommodation has long been felt by the Presbyterian Sunday School. Last Sunday a committee was appointed to give the matter consideration and devise some plan for securing a new building or remodeling and extending the present one, so as to provide the room so necessary to the convenience and good working of the school. The committee will hold a joint meeting with the elders and board of trustees of the church on the first Monday in February, when some plan of action will probably be decided upon. The present chapel was built nearly 40 Yes ago, under the pastorate of N. C. Locke, but the original building has been increased in size.
