  - Acts 2:46 describes the communal nature of early Christian communities. From the King James Version: “<sup>43</sup> And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles. <sup>44</sup> And all that believed were together, and had all things common; <sup>45</sup> And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need. **<sup>46</sup> And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,** <sup>47</sup> Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.”

  - [Reverend Zachariah Greene](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/104470828/zachariah-greene) (11 Jan 1760 to 21 Jun 1858). Reverend Greene moved to Hempstead in 1849 to live with his daughter, Mary Howard (Greene) Thompson, the wife of the famous historian Benjamin F. Thompson who died 21 Mar 1849.

  - "The village now known as Freeport was part of an area called "the Great South Woods" during colonial times. In the mid-17th century, the area was renamed **Raynor South**, and ultimately Raynortown, after a herdsman named Edward Raynor, who had moved to the area from Hempstead in 1659, cleared land, and built a cabin."

Religious Intelligence—The Rev. N.C. Locke, late pastor of the Central Presbyterian church, in this city, was installed over “Christ's Church,” Hempstead, L.I., on Wednesday the 4th inst. Introductory exercises by Rev. P. D. Oakley of Jamaica; sermon from Acts. 2:46, by Rev. Hugh N. Wilson of Southampton; constitutional questions by Rev. W. Bailey, of Middle Island; charge to the pastor by Rev. James McDougal, of Huntington—and to the people by Rev. Franklin Merrill, of Raynor South. Says our informant, a gentleman present from this city “We have seldom attended exercises more interesting; and cannot but wish for Mr. Locke, all the success which his talents and general popularity seem to demand. He is the tenth pastor of this venerable old church, planted some two hundred and six years ago, and now large and flourishing. — We noticed in the pulpit the Rev. and venerable Father Greene, who made some interesting remarks at the close, He was once a soldier in the army of Washington, doing good service for his country—since, for sixty years, a faithful soldier in the army of Christ—now tho oldest. Presbyterian minister in the United States, and resides in Hempstead.” Long may the venerable patriot and christian yet live.
