Extraordinary Optical Illusion.â€”Professor Wheatstone, in his indefatigable researches into the abstruse but beautifully interesting phenomena of light and optics, discovered a property in optics, previous to the perfecting of calotype pictures, to which Mr. Cundell has since successfully applied it, and which, whilst most extraordinary in an optical point of view, will probably lead to discoveries in the delicate arts of obtaining sun-light pictures, and the effects resulting from them, of very considerable importance. A board is provided, about two feet long, and a few inches in breadth, at each end of which is an upright piece truly perpendicular, with a groove at top and bottom, for sliding in a picture. In the centre of this board, at the height of the centre of the uprights, are placed two small mirrors, at an angle of forty-five degrees with the edges of the board, or ninety degrees with each other, in front of which is a piece of metal with sight holes, sufficiently apart to suit the sight. On placing two calotype pictures of the same object in the grooves, against the uprights, such, for instance, as a jug, vase, piece of statuary, geometrical figures, &c., each eye, of course, sees the reflection in the corresponding mirror of one picture only, the left-hand picture being seen by the left eye, and the right hand picture by the right eye; yet the singular result of this arrangement is, that the spectator sees before him a *fac-simile* of the object from which the pictures were obtained in its original state, with the lights, the shadows, the under cuttings, and all the full roundedness and projecting points of the solid body. In fact, so complete and beautiful is the illusion, that it is impossible, by any attempt, to see the pictures as viewed separately, and a perfectly finished solid body is represented to the eye of the astonished viewer. It must be pictures taken by sunlight, in different points of sight, to have the effect, as no two drawings by hand could be done sufficiently correct to prevent confusion in the shadows, and meeting of the corresponding lines. Professor Wheatstone, in the first instance, applied it to the representation of geometrical solids, which may be drawn mathematically true and shaded to nature. We are indebted to Messrs. Horne, Thornthwaite, and Wood, opticians, of Newgate street, for an inspection of this singular phonomenon; [sic] which, with a good collection of duplicate calotype pictures, would produce a source of endless amusement.
