Honor to a Hempstead Clergyman. â€”We observe by the Montgomery *Journal*, that the degree of D. D., has been conferred on the Rev N. C. Locke, of the Presbyterian Church in this village, by a Southern College. This is a compliment from a competent and worthy source, for talents well-known and highly appreciated at the South, some years ago, Mr. Locke graduated at Middlebury College, in 1838 ; was first settled as a Pastor in Virginia, then in Brooklyn, and last in this village, (Hempstead), where he has officiated with great acceptance for the past seven years, having added many members to the church as seals of his ministry.
