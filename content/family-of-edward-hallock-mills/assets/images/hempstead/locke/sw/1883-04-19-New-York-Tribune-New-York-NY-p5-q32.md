SAMUEL WALLIN. 

Samuel Wallin, the artist, died at his home at No. 10 Cottage-place on Tuesday afternoon of pleuropneumonia. Mr. Wallin was born in London, in 1811, and was the son of Samuel Wallin, once well-known as an engraver in this city. In childhood he displayed artistic ability, and at eighteen opened a store at No. 27 Chatham-st. as an engraver and artist, where he attracted the attention of the late Frank Leslie, with whom he engaged himself and remained over thirty years. Two years ago he opened an office at No. 7 Murray-st. He was a bachelor, and has made his home with his niece, Mrs. Halsey, for many years. The funeral will take place on Friday at 2 o'clock from his home.
