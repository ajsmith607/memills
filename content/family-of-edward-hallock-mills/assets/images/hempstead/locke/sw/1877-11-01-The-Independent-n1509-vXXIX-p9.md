...The publication of the fifteenth and sixteenth parts of Mrs. Martha J. Lambâ€™s History of the City of New York completes the first volume and brings the history down to the beginning of the Revolution. The work is an excellent one, being written in a readable style, with due attention to the various threads of story which must be woven together in a history. The mechanical execution is good, and the artists employed in illustrating the work are Messrs. Alfred Fredericks, Sol Eytinge, Jr., C. S. Reinhart, George E. White, J. D. Woodward, Thomas Beach, Abram Hosier, and Samuel Wallin.
