Samuel Wallin, who died at his home, No. 10 Cottage-place, Tuesday afternoon, was in the earlier days of illustrated journalism famed for his execution of heads. He was for 30 years in the publishing-house of Frank Leslie, and in his time drew the portrait of almost every man of prominence in the country. He was born in London, and came to this country at the age of 3 years with his mother to join his father, a skilled watch engraver. Mr. Wallin died at the age of 72, of pleuropneumonia. Out of a family of seven children he was the last surviving member except a sister living in Minneapolis, Minn.
