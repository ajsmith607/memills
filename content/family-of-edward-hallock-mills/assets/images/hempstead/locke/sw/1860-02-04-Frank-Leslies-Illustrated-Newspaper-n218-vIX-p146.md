For the future of our paper, we can assure the tens of thousands of our readers that we shall use still greater efforts to retain their support and increase the scope of its usefulness. We have now all the most talented artists and the best engravers engaged on it, *who work for it exclusively,* and as a farther proof of what we mean to do, we announce that we have made an engagement with 

MR. SAMUEL WALLIN, 

the finest portrait draughtsman upon wood in America. From this date he will draw for our paper exclusively. 

He has maintained his position as the first portrait draughteman in America, for the past ten years, during which period he has drawn over *three thousand portraits*. All the finest portraits in the past numbers of our paper, such as Sickles, Seward and others, and all the best portraits in *Harper's Weekly*, were from Wallin's pencil, his reputation as the only man who can draw an accurate portrait insuring him the monopoly of that class of work. He will now draw exclusively for *Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper*. 

This is one of the many brilliant engagements contemplated by us for the future of our paperâ€”engagements which will keep us, as heretofore, far beyond the reach of all competition.
