The Rev. N. C. Locke, late pastor of the Central Presbyterian Church, in Brooklyn, was installed over “Christ’s Church," Hempstead, L. I., on Wednesday, the 4th inst. The exercises were very interesting. Mr. Locke is the tenth pastor of this venerable old church, planted some 206 years ago, and now large and flourishing. 

The Rev. and venerable Father Greene, was among those in the pulpit, and made some interesting remarks at the close. He was once a soldier in the army of Washington, doing good service for his country—since, for 60 years, a faithful soldier in the army of Christ, now the oldest Presbyterian minister in the United States, and resides in Hempstead.
