LOYAL SON OF OLD BLUE SIGNS HIS OWN NAME TO THIS WEEK'S ARTICLE 

There are some folks in Old Blue who do not know or never had an idea that Old Blue was quite a man‘ufacturing place at one time and had @ carpet weaving establishment here, It falls to “Loyal Son” tolet the younger generation know that this burgh had one at one time. It was wwituated on. the edge of the brook -crogsing Fulton avenue. It was run by William Pray, the father of the Rev. W. T. Pray and our respected merchant Elias L. Pray. Mr. Pray had his looms in the rear of his res‘idence the second house on Fulton avenue east of Clinton street. He did a thriving business. He was a devout Christian and a member of the M. E. Church in the late sixties. Later he moved his looms to a house on Clinton street now occupied by Mr. Bacigalupo our fruit merchant. 

During a conversation with the editor recently he remarked to me that a large number of persons had asked 

the question as to who was “A Loyal 

Son.” Gentle reader I suppose I must let you know who “Loyal Son” is. When I write the word Loyal, I mean all that the word Loyal means. It is an old saying here “They all come back” and it is true that when @ person leaves this beautiful village he yearns always to return. Don’t you think I am right? I know from experience... 

I believe that it will be interesting

Another question I want to ask some of the old men of this village. Can you tell me who the owners of Belmont Pond were? Years ago there was only a stream of water flowing. . The residence was owned by Mr. Monroe; later it became Williams Park, then Bennetts Park then Lowdens Pond ‘and finally Belmont’s. 

Can you recall the days when the tam yards were located in the rear of Pray’s market on Front street. All the cattle that was killed there used to be taken to the town vats to be tanned and shipped to market.
