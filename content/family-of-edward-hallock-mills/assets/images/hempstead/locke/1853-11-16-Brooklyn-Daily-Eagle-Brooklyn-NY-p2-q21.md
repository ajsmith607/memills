BUSINESS NOTICES.  

Going! Going!! Gone!!!â€”The friends of Mr. Joseph Hegeman, the well known Brooklyn Auctioneer, will learn, we think, with considerable pleasure, that from the success which has followed his earnest endeavors to give satisfaction to his patrons, he has found his Sales Room, at 191 Washington street, altogether inadequate for his business purposes, and has therefore removed to Willoughby, corner of Pearl st., to the capacious building, occupied for a long time by the members of the Central Presbyterian Church. He has, at a great cost, converted it into one of the finest sales rooms to be found either in New York or Brooklyn, where his friends will doubtless rally round him as heretofore. As a business man, Mr. H. has few superiors, as a prompt man in his settlements with his various customers, none. To give the public some idea of the capacity of the new room, for containing goods, we subjoin some particulars of the alterations. The pews have, of necessity, all been removed, and a broad and capacious gallery has been erected for the display of fancy goods. There is a lower apartment appropriated to business purposes. The steeple has been removed and a flagstaff erected in its place. On the days of sale the stars and stripes will be hoisted, to give notice to the public that the renowned Auctioneer will deliver on that day one of a business lecture. This capacious building presents altogether a very handsome appearance. The first sale, consisting of a large stock of furs, takes place on Thursday next, this will be a rare opportunity for the ladies, and will, doubtless, attract a large audience. We wish the new encumbent of the old Central Presbyterian Church, a successful career. We perceive that Mr. H. has well placarded Brooklyn with the announcement of his first sale, but were somewhat surprised to see a New York printer's name attached to it.
