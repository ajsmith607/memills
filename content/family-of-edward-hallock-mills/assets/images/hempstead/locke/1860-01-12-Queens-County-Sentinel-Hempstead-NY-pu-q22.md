Deserved Compliment. 

We have been favored with a sight of the gift of the Long Island Bible Society to the Rev. N. C, Locke of this village, on his resignation of his part of recording Secretary, after 7 years of arduous service. It was accompanied by letters of acknowledgement of his faithful and valuable services, from the President Laurens Reeves Esq., and the present recording Secretary G. A. Shelton. The Bible is in the finest style of English Imperial Quarto, on vellum paper, exquisitely bound and bears the following inscription:– 

“Presented by the Board of Managers of the Long Island Bible Society, to the Rev. N. C. Locke D. D., as a Testimonial of their high regards, and appreciation of Seven years service as Corresponding Secretary, Nov. 15th, 1859.”
