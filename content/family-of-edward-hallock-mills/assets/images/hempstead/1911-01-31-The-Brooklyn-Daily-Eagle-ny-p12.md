Esther Mills. 

Hempstead, L. I., January 31â€”Funeral services were held yesterday for Mrs. Esther Mills, who died at Nassau Hospital on January 27, aged 79 years, Mrs. Mills was noted in the neighborhood where she lived for her great love of flowers. The begonias she raised were the admiration of professional gardeners. The Rev. Dr. F. M. Kerr officiated at the funeral and interment was made in Greenfield Cemetery. Mrs. Miller [sic] was the wife of an old resident of Hempstead,  Robert S. Mills, and the daughter of Richard and Phebe Losea, She was born in East Williston, and was married in 1858. For some years previous to coming to Hempstead village to live, Mr. and Mrs. Mills occupied the Richard Losea homestead, about two miles from the village. This house is nearly one hundred years old, and is still a landmark. Mrs. Mills was a member of the Presbyterian Church and a devoted wife and mother. The golden wedding of Mr. and Mrs. Mills was quietly celebrated three years ago at their Grove street residence, where the funeral services were held. Besides her husband, Mrs. Mills is survived by one son, William H. Mills, of Brooklyn.
