Death of Rev. Dr. Locke.— The Rev. Nathaniel C. Locke, D.D., late pastor of the Presbyterian Church, at Hempstead, L.I., died in New York, on Monday, July 21st. Dr. Locke was for several years pastor of the Central Presbyterian Church, Brooklyn, and afterwards at Hempstead. He resigned his last charge on account of the state of his health, which has been so feeble for two or three years past, that he has performed but little ministerial labor. In addition to other causes of prostration, he suffered for some months, from a cancer, which was the immediate cause of his death. His only child died on the 15th inst., after an illness of a few hours. Dr. Locke was an able, discriminating, and impressive preacher, and gave evidence, wherever he was called to labor, of a sincere and earnest devotion to the great work of the ministry. He was, from its organization up to the time of his death, a member of the Presbytery of Nassau.
