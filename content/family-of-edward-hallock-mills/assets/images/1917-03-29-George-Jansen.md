    - Em is a reference to Emma (English) Wheeler (1875-1968), wife of Clarence Wheeler (1876-1951). George writes of both often. 

    - On 24 Mar 1917, George noted "New Proprietor meat market opens to day". According to Gertrude Conant in her contribution to *A Drive-by Tour of the Town of Caroline* (Tour 4-P8), the meat market was across the street from Mills' home at present day 470 Brooktondale Road, the Todi's home: "'Calf' Charlie Vandemark had a meat market here, next to his house. It was later owned by Clarence Wheeler who also had a meat cart and went around the town selling door to door." A photo that presumably shows Clarence standing next to a horse-drawn wagon bearing his name can be found on the bottom of page 86 of *Around Caroline* by Patricia A. Brhel.
