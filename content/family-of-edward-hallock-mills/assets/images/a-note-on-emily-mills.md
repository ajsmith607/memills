#### A Note on Emily Mills

Before David VanDeMark's mother Grace died, he had found in her sewing
machine (which had been acquired from Clara Lockwood) a little leatherette booklet
labeled on the outside "M. E. MILLS, DEALER IN DRY GOODS, GROCERIES, HARDWARE
AND CROCKERY, BROOKTON, N.Y." On the inside is a calendar covering July 1909 to
July 1910, a pack of needles and a fabric needle holder. The text says "This is a
complete set of needles for all purposes. All the best imported. We would very much
appreciate your patronage when anything in our line is needed.”

Mary Emily Mills, known as Emily, was born in 1861 and died in 1937. In the
1892 Census she is listed as a "clerk" in her father's store. Emily's father was Edward
H. Mills, who died January 1, 1908, leaving "stock and accounts of a going, general
merchandise business in the village of Brookton" and a parcel known as “the Mills
Store lot,” valued at $500. Edward Mills died without a will, and Emily was appointed
executor of the estate, being more competent for such business than her elderly
mother Hannah, The estate was settled in August, 1909, so the little sewing booklet
represents Emily Mills’ first attempt at advertising after she took over the store.

The Mills Store was located in the building which Brooktondale residents know
today as the "old postoffice," across the street from the TNT. Mr. Mills had operated a
store for 29 years (and was postmaster during the Cleveland administration), but we
don’t know if it was always in this location. The family lived across the street in a
house built on "part of the Grist Mill Lot" [the Grist Mill foundation supports the
current Dalebrook Apartments]. In 1891 the house was owned by Esther Vorhis, but
was occupied by E. H. Mills "as tenant." The house lot was measured starting at "the
Center of the bridge crossing the Mill race." The property was sold to Mr. Mills by
Edward and Amanda Lounsbery in 1903.

Emily Mills died in 1937, having kept the store with its "kerosene, kerosene
lamps with green shades, penny candy, stockings, handkerchiefs, yard goods, pins
and sewing notions, sheets and pillowcases" (and groceries) all that time. Her
obituary notes that she "aided materially the Caroline welfare director by extending
credit for groceries to many needy individuals." Jessie Brewer, who had grown up in
the house next door as Jessie Shurter, bought the store and Emily's house and 
continued the business, adding a lending library in the back room. In 1961, Charles
Vorhis bought the store and moved the post office across the street from the current
TNT Market, where it had occupied the side addition.
