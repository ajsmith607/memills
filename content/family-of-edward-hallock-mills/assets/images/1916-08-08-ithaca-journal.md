HORSE WANDERS HERE ALONE FROM BROOKTON

A horse belonging to Charles Bacon 53, who was kicked in the temple by a day night [sic] and when left alone in Brookton after returning from Ithaca, turned around and came alone back to this city. The horse was found the next night in the Genung hitching stable in East Seneca street. The horse succeeded in making the trip unnoticed. Mr. Bacon had driven to Ithaca Saturday night and returned late at night but stopped at the Mills store before going to his home. Mr. Bacon drove the horse back Sunday night.
