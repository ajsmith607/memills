$50,000 FIRE IN CORE, .N. Y. 

[By The Associated Press.] 

BATAVIA, N. Y., April 28.—The village of Corfu, ten miles west of here, suffered severely from fire last night. The explosion of a can of gasoline in Bradley’s hardware store caused a big blaze which communicated to Dickinson’s hotel, a shoe shop and barber shop and the Methodist church, all of which were destroyed. The village has no fire fighting apparatus. The loss will reach $50,000, with very little insurance.
