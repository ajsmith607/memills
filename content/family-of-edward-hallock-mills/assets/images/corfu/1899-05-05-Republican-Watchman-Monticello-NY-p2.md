Gasoline Explosion at Corfu. 

The village of Corfu suffered severely from fire a few days ago. The explosion of a can of gasoline in Bradley’s hardware store caused a big blaze, which communicated to Dickenson’s Hotel, a shoe shop, and barber's shop, and the Methodist Church, all of which were destroyed. The village has no fire-fighting apparatus. The loss will reach $50,000, with very little insurance.
