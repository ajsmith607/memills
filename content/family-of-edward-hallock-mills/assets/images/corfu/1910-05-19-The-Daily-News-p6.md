MRS. W. W. MAC GREGOR.

Aged Resident of Corfu, Born in Darien, Died of Heart Disease.

Corfu, May 19.—Mrs. Lucy Anna Sumner MacGregor, wife of William W. MacGregor, died at her home in this village last evening of heart disease. 

Mrs. MacGregor was born in the town of Darien about 78 years ago, on Daniel Sumner’s farm, where her father and mother lived many years. On April 19, 1856, she was married to Mr. MacGregor, who alone survives her. She had been ill with heart trouble for about five months and had suffered much, but her last hours were peaceful.

The funeral will be on Sunday at 5 p. m. from the house, the Rev. Harry M. Wright of Batavia officiating. The interment will be in the Evergreen Hill cemetery.
