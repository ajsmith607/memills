CORFU FIRE STRICKEN 

DEVASTATING FLAMES EAT OUT A SQUARE IN THE VERY HEART OF ITS BUSINESS PORTION. 

SIX BUILDINGS BURN 

PROPERTY VALUED AT $18,700 GOES UP IN SMOKE IN A REMARKABLY SHORT TIME. 

Fire Started, Evidently From Spontaneous Combustion, in the Paint Room in Palmer & Wagner's Hardware Store and Spread With Terrible Rapidity—That Structure, the Central Hotel, the Methodist Church, the Only Brick Building in the Place, Mrs. A. E. Ogden’s Store and Residence Property and Two Other Structures Quickly Consumed — Firemen, Without Any Apparatus of Value, Worked Like Trojans and Finally Got the Flames Under Control—The Total Amount of Insurance Only $8,750. 

A great black hole in the heart of the business portion of Corfu is a monument to the awful power of devastating flames. Within a comparatively brief space of time late yesterday afternoon half a dozen buildings in that village went up in smoke and $18,700 worth of property was destroyed, upon which there was aggregate insurance of only $8,750, The burned section covers a square at the corner of Main and Alabama streets, north of the former and east of the latter. In addition a barn in the rear of a house on the west side of Alabama street was burned. 

One of the buildings consumed was the Methodist-Protestant church on Alabama street, the only brick structure in the place, The other places destroyed were Palmer & Wagner's hardware store on Main street, in which the fire started; the Central hotel just east of the hardware store; Maynard & Stevens's annex, A variety store on the corner of Main and Alabama streets, opposite that firm’s main store; Mrs. A. E. Ogden’s dwelling, in the rear of and connected with Maynard & Stevens’s annex, and a building between the dwelling and the Methodist church in which Daniel Schelt's shoe shop and D. A. Schelt’s barber shop were located, the latter having living apartments on the second floor. With only a small hand engine and a hook and ladder truck in the way of fire fighting apparatus the village was completely at the mercy of the flames for a time. The hardest kind of work on the part of men, women and children and the fact that there was no wind when the conflagration was at its height were all that saved the village from almost complete destruction. Corfu has had several bad fires, but this one, beyond a doubt, was the most disastrous in its history. 

The only theory that can be considered in regard to the origin of the fire is that it was caused by spontaneous combustion. It started about 5:15 o'clock In the oil and paint department of Palmer & Wagner's hardware store, A narrow, two-story structure, about 75 feet long. Charles Palmer, son of the senior member of the firm and a clerk in the store, and Charles Collins, a painter, were in the paint room at the time.

“Mr. Collins came in to purchase some japan drier,” Mr. Palmer told a reporter tor THE NEWS, "I was pouring it from a 5-gallon can into a quart can, which Mr. Collins was holding, when suddenly, without a moment’s warning, we were encircled by flames. The blaze seemed tostart from the floor, but communicated instantly to the japan. 

“I threw the can out of a window and ran out into the street and shouted fire. I then started back in to lock the safe, which was about in the center of the store, but it was so hot that I couldn’t get to it. The floor of the paint room was saturated with oil, so the fire spread very rapidly. 

“Mr, Collins followed me out of the store with his clothing on fire. Both of his hands were badly burned before we could put the fire out.”

A general alarm Was quickly sounded on the Presbyterian church bell and the fire company had its hand engine on the scene in a few minutes. The one small stream thrown from it had not the slightest effect upon the fames, which soon burst through the roof and high into the air, scattering blazing brands upon the roofs of adjoining buildings. Every able-bodied person in the village turned out to and the firemen, and informal bucket brigades and protective companies were quickly formed.

It being evident at the outset that the hardware store was doomed the people directed their attention to endeavoring to save adjoining property. The Central hotel, owned and occupied by William Dickinson, a 2 story building about fifty feet square, was situated close to the hardware store on the east. It was quickly seen that that, too, was bound to go and willing bands hastily removed as much of its contents as possible, The structure was soon wrapped in flames. There was a narrow  row alley on the west side of the hardware store, separating it from the 2 story structure on the corner of Main and Alabama streets, owned by Mrs. A. E. Ogden. The front half of the building was occupied by Maynard & Stevens, who had a variety store there, managed by Ray Duguid, while the rear half Mrs. Ogden, her daughter, Mrs. Emma Bradley, and her grandson, Ray Bradley, occupied as a residence. The Bell Telephone company had a pay station there. This structure caught fire almost as soon as the hotel and burned just as rapidly. Nothing was saved from the store, but some of the furniture in the residence portion was got out safely. 

Daniel Schelt’s small 2-story building was located but a few feet north of the Ogden structure on the east side of Alabama street and west of the rear end of the Palmer & Wagner store. The contents of D. A. Schelt’s barber shop and a part of the effects in his living rooms on the second floor were gotten out before the building caught fire, but nothing was saved from Daniel Schelt's shoe store and shop on the first floor. 

Next north of the Schelt building on Alabama street was the Methodist church, which, as it was a tall brick building, having a basement under the auditorium, it was hoped could be saved, Burning brands fell thick and fast, however, upon the shingled roof, well seasoned by years of exposure, and in a remarkably short time the whole interior of the edifice was a roaring furnace. The well-built brick walls refused to give way to the power of the flames, however, and this fact kept the fire from
