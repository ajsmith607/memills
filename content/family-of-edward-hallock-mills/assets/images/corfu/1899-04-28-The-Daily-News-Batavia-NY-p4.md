CORFU FIRE STRICKED 

Continued from first page.

spreading further to the north. On they opposite side of Alabama street Dr. F. W. Crane’s handsome residence is situated. It looked for a time as though that would go, too, but by the hardest kind of work it was saved. Brands were carried over and by it, however, to a barn owned by Mrs. Anna E. Edwards, located in the rear of Mrs. Edwards's house on Main street. The barn burned very rapidly. A horse, several vehicles and harnesses were gotten out, but a  cutter, a quantity of farming implements and hay and grain were burned, The barn was the last structure to be consumed. Several other buildings caught fire a number of times, but the flames were quickly put out. It was feared that the Barden Hall building, a large structure on Main street, east of the Central hotel, would burn, but it has a slate roof and this made it possible to more easily protect it from the flames. It was on fire, however, several times. Burning brands also set fire to the residences of Dr. Bates and George. M. Bailey, fully 300 feet west of Alabama street on Main street, but hardly any damage was done there. 

Considering the fact that they had practically nothing to work with the firefighters did remarkable work in preventing a further spread of the conflagration, A request for aid was sent to Batavia about 6 p.m., when it looked as though the whole town was going, and the Central officials here got an engine and a flat car ready. As Corfu has no waterworks system, however, the Batavia department's apparatus would have been useless, so none of the companies responded. Later the Corfu people telegraphed to Buffalo for assistance. A fire engine was loaded on a flat car in that city and a telegram was then sent to Corfu asking if it should be sent. By that time the fire was under control and the Buffalonians were told not to come, About 10:30 o'clock last night a strong wind came up, which sent clouds of sparks flying from the smouldering ruins and it was feared for a time that there might be more trouble, but a number of men stayed up all night Keeping a close watch and no new fires broke out. 

The heaviest sufferers as a result of the fire are Palmer & Wagner. Their loss is nearly $6,500 and they had a total of $4,200 insurance on the building and stock. They recently increased their already large stock by adding over $600 worth of goods to it, Everything in the store, including the books, was consumed. The firm will rebuild immediately. 

The next heaviest loser is William Dickinson, proprietor of the Central hotel. His loss is close to $4,300, He had $2,500 insurance on his building, but nothing on the contents. Most of his furniture was burred and he lost several hundred dollars worth of liquors. 

The Methodist church was worth probably about $3,000, and there was not a cent of insurance upon it. All that was saved from the building were the organ and pulpit Bible. It is doubtful if the church will be rebuilt, as the Methodist society is small in numbers. 

Mrs. A. E. Ogden’s loss is fully $3,000. She had $1,000 insurance on her building, but none om contents. Most of her household goods burned up. Maynard & Stevens’s variety stock in the same building was insured for $500, which will cover the loss. 

Daniel Schelt's building was insured for $400, which will half cover the loss on it. He lost about $100 on the contents, with no insurance, D. A. Schelt lost about $100 on furniture and barber shop fixtures, with no insurance. Mr. Schelt will rebuild at once. 

Mrs. A.A. Edwards insured her barn on Wednesday for $150. Her loss is about $400. 

Of Palmer & Wagner’s insurance John C. Holmes of Batavia had $1,000 on the building and a like sum on the stock and S. A. Sherwin of Batavia had $1,500 on the stock and tools and $200 on the building, The remaining $500 was held by Dwight Dimock of Corfu, In whose agency all of the balance of the burned property was insured. 

The Corfu Fire company had arranged for a dance at the Union hotel last night and the programme was carried out, although it was pretty late before the festivities commenced. The event was well attended.
