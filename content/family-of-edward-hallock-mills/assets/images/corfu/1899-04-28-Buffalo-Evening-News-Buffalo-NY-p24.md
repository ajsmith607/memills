Corfu Visited by a Disastrous Fire, Which Destroys the Business Portion. 

[SPECIAL TO THE EVENING NEWS.]

BATAVIA, N. Y., April 28,â€”The finest buildings in the business portion of Corfu were reduced to ashes last evening. and the loss is roughly estimated by Batavia insurance men at from $25,000 to $35,000. 

At 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon there was an explosion In Bradley's hardware store near where the oils, etc, were kept. The fire spread rapidly in all directions, and in 10 minutes the building was In flames. 

The Dickinson Hotel, the next building north, was soon on fire; then came the store of Maynard & Stevens, who did a general mercantile business. From there the fire was communicated to the residence of Mrs. E. A. Ogden, which was burned with its contents. Soon the Methodist Church near by was seen to be afire. By this time several thousand people from the surrounding country were present and doing all they could. 

Word was wired to Batavia, in the excitement of the moment, for those companies, and Supt. Hay of the Central had an engine and flat car ready at 6 o'clock, but it was decided not to send them as they would be useless, Corfu not having any waterworks system. 

A barn belonging to Mrs. A. E, Edwards was destroyed with its contents. Several surrounding houses were on fire many times, but the volunteer bucket brigades saved them. 

Batavia insurance men are at the scene today, The total insurance, it is claimed, will not be above $15,000, There was no insurance on the church, but the hotel carried a $2200 policy. The Maynard & Stevens stock of about $1000 is a total loss. The shoe shop and barber shop conducted by David and Daniel Scheltz were also total losses, It leaves Corfu's business portion a mass of debris. S.
