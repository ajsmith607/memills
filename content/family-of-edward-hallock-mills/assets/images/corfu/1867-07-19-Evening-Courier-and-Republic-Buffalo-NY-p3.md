  According to Wikipedia, "The Western House of Refuge was a youth detention center in Rochester, New York; it was the first state managed reformatory in the United States, housing males under the age of eighteen who had been convicted of felonies in courts located in the central and western part of New York State. In 1876, a Female Department was established; in 1886, the name was changed to the State Industrial School. In 1907, it was renamed the State Agricultural & Industrial School and moved to Industry, New York. Its former drill hall was transformed into Edgerton Park Arena. It operated from 1849 to 1960."

LIKES STYLE.—Frank Jones, a boy of 12 years, is fond of style. His own wearing apparel having become rather the worse for wear, he entered the store of E. H. Mills & Co., of Corfu, on the 14th, and appropriated a suit of clothing, without as much as saying “by your leave.” The result was, that Frank found himself charged with larceny, and there being no question of his guilt, he was sent to the Western House of Refuge at Rochester.
