WILLIAM W. M'GREGOR.

Death of an Aged and Highly Esteemed Resident of Corfu.

Corfu, Nov. 6.—William W. MacGregor, an old and highly esteemed resident of Corfu, died at 3:30 o’clock yesterday morning from the infirmities of age. He had been in very good health and walked down town nearly every day until a month ago, when he fell and had not been well since. His mental faculties were somewhat impaired.

Mr. MacGregor was born in London, Eng., on October 10, 1822, and in April 1851, came to America, going first to Akron, then Pavilion and coming to Corfu nearly fifty years ago. On April 19, 1856, he married Lucy Ann Sumner, who died on May 18, 1910. In September 1910, the only surviving member of his immediate family, his sister, Miss Sophia MacGregor, left her home in Sussex, Eng., to come to America for the first time, to make her home with her brother. She is 83 years of age. Besides his sister Mr. MacGregor leaves several nephews and nieces.

Mr. MacGregor was apprenticed as a saddler in Perth, Scotland, and continued as a harness maker in this country until April 1900, when he sold his business at Corfu to M. L. Hanford. He was secretary of the Evergreen Hill Cemetery Association when it was organized on February 9, 1878, and was its treasurer for many years, resigning from that office six years ago. He had served as justice and had been town clerk, village clerk and notary public. He was a member of the Presbyterian church. 

In a letter written to his sister on March 18, 1851, from Edinburgh, Scotland, Mr. MacGregor said: “On the 28th of this month I sail from Greenock for New York in the ship ‘Adonis.’ You know I long wished to emigrate and now the time has come. My berth is taken and part of my passage paid. The ‘Adonis’ is a very large vessel, 1,200 tons burden, and will take out a great many emigrants, I believe two or three hundred. I have taken what is called an immediate passage which costs four pounds.”

Mr. MacGregor’s funeral will be held from the house at 3:30 o’clock tomorrow afternoon. The interment will be in the Evergreen Hill cemetery.
