SACKING A SANCTUARY. 

The Dutch Reformed church at Slaterville which has been closed for several months was visited a few days ago by a Mrs. Gibbs, who resides in the parsonage near by. Upon entering the church Mrs. Gibbs discovered the fact that it had been almost completely stripped of everything valued, except the pulpit chairs and a table, The church carpet had been taken up and carried away and all the lamp globes had been confiscated. Suspicion rests upon two or three well known parties m the locality who will doubtless be apprehended in a short time.
