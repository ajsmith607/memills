VANDALISM in MOTTS CORNERS–CHRISTIANS PROTEST.

Motts Corners, March 26.

Editors Ithaca Journal:

Our sensibilities have been often taxed by reading of surprising cruelties and atrocities in Bulgaria and among the Indians on the plains. We were however hardly prepared to believe that in our own community could be found men destitute of feeling and of human sympathy. You will learn with sorrowful surprise that the good and thoughtful people of Motts Corners have been obliged to witness in their midst scenes of unparalleled cruelty;

Scenes which touch the stoutest heart.

There has been living in our midst for a year, or (possibly two of them) an honest, hard working and temperate man. He is kindly spoken of by those who have given him employment, and also by his neighbors in other places. His family consists of his wife, three small children and an infant less than three weeks old. In the midst of great poverty and destitution this poor family have been modest and uncomplaining. Upon various occasions during the past six or eight weeks, unfeeling and brutal persons have, under the cover of night, surrounded the wretched house which shelters this poor man; seemingly unwilling that this unfortunate family and their innocent little children, should forget their troubles in sleep, these rioters keeping up a vigorous bombardment with stones and other missiles, breaking in the windows, scattering the glass among the terrified and screaming children, and I am informed hitting in several instances other members of the family. Sometimes this assault is continued without much abatement for half an hour and can be distinctly heard for at least a quarter of a mile. And all this occurred notwithstanding the mother was approaching confinement, and amidst the poor man’s tearful and piteous appeals for protection for his helpless family. Through your columns permit me to ask how long in the name of God and humanity are these shameful and riotous proceedings to be allowed and the lives of this poor family to be endangered. I am informed that the little crockery the poor family possessed as well as their lamp has been destroyed by the rioters. Some of the persons who have a hand in this heartless business I am told consider themselves or claim to be up to the level of the common intelligence; and yet the only excuse they offer for this disgraceful conduct is that this poor man was permitted to care for his wife during her confinement, a friendless and homeless woman, herself a mother with an infant child, and touching whose character they claim to have heard or seen something which was not creditable. There is a strong feeling here that these rioters should be taught a severe lesson and that the words are wasted on such men, but I would remind them of the blessing which the Savior pronounced on the merciful “For they shall obtain mercy,” and hope that they may yet be guided by right and generous feelings and have–not stones for those that are unfortunate and at the bottom of society–but rather words of generous and encouraging sympathy.

H. B. Gilbert

P. S. The rioters again visited this family last night and broke in the windows, and for safety the children and inmates had to take refuge in the upper rooms of the house. Cannot some measures be taken to put an end to this cruelty and injustice?
