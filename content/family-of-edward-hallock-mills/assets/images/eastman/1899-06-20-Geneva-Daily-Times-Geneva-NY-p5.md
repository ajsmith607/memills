RECEPTION AT HIGH SCHOOL

Annual Event Occurred Last Night.

A Large Attendance at the Opening of the June Festivities. 

The annual reception given by the teachers to the patrons and friends of the city schools was held in the assembly room of the. High school from 8 until 11 o'clock last evening, It was largely attended.

To the teachers the annual reception is the most important event of commencement week, and they arrange and work and plan for it just as the pupils do for commencement. That their plans were crowned with success was evidenced last evening by the attractive manner in which the reception room was decorated and in the graceful way in which the reception line was arranged. Just within the main door at the entrance to the High school, stood Prof. Truesdale, superintendent of the city schools, Miss Hancock, vice principal of the High school, and Miss Parker, preceptress of the High school, who received, To their rear and toward the reception room stood other teachers either singly or in groups, welcoming visitors or surrounded by a bevy of merry, laughing friends. The teachers were happy, too, for they were looking forward to the long vacation and backward over another year completed.

The faces in the tine were a study. Some were light and happy and full of the excitement of the moment, while others looked beyond and saw that when school opens next year many who were in the line last evening will have gone to other, perhaps wider fields. Among those in the line were teachers whose years of experience could be counted on the fingers of a single hand, while others spanned more than a quarter of a century.

The corridor from the entrance to the assembly room doors was decorated with roses, palms and ferns. The people began to come before 8 o'clock, the hour set for the reception to begin. As they entered they were cordially greeted by Prof. Truesdale, Miss Hancock, and Miss Parker, and then passed toward the assembly room, which they entered by the east door. The teachers were grouped in an arc from door to door. The room was decorated with roses, daisies, ferns, and other plants, The orchestra was stationed on the rostrum behind a screen of palms. When the reception closed at 11 o'clock many said that it was the most successful ever held in the High school.
