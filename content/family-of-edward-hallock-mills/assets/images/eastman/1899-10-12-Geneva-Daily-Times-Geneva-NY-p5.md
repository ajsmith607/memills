  - According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organdy): "Organdy or Organdie is a kind of sheer fabric. It is a lightweight balanced plain weave cotton with features of sheerness and crispness. ...Organdy was used for bridal dresses, ladies party dresses, and blouses. Organdy was a useful material as a Casement cloth, sheers, and lining etc. In the old days (late 19th and 20th century), young girls used to wear dresses made of organdy. Because the material had a wrinkling tendency due to stiffened properties, handkerchiefs and child clothing were not chosen."
  - A possible explanation for "articles of Batenberg work" via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battenberg_cake): "Charles Nevin wrote in The Independent: “Battenberg cake is exemplarily British. The first cake was baked in 1884 to celebrate Prince Louis of Battenberg marrying Princess Victoria, Queen Victoria’s granddaughter and Prince Philip’s grandmother.” ...Battenberg or Battenburg (with either 'cake' or 'square' added on the end) is a light sponge cake with different sections held together with jam. The cake is covered in marzipan and, when cut in cross section, displays a distinctive two-by-two check pattern alternately coloured pink and yellow. The large chequered patterns on emergency vehicles in the UK are officially referred to as Battenburg markings because of their resemblance to the cake."
  - Again, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_University_of_New_York_at_Geneseo): "The State University of New York College at Geneseo (SUNY Geneseo, Geneseo State College or, colloquially, "Geneseo"), is a public liberal arts college in Geneseo, New York. It is part of the State University of New York (SUNY) system. The college was founded in 1867 as the Geneseo Normal School before it became a state liberal arts college in 1948."
