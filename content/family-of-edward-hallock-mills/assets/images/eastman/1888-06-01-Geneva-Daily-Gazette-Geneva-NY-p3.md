About two weeks ago, Miss Hancock, vice-principal at our Classical & Union School, was summoned home (Missouri) by a telegram announcing the alarming illness of her father. Letters received announce her bereavement by the death of her father, which occurred on Saturday last. Miss Hancock will accompany the remains to their place of interment in Wisconsin, and then resume her journey to Geneva.
