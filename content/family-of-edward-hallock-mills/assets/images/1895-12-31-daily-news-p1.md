    - "Mr. and Mrs. W. W. McGregor" is referencing William MacGregor (10 Oct 1822 to 06 Nov 1915) and [Lucy Ann (Sumner) MacGregor](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/75957932/lucy-ann-macgregor) (1832 to 18 May 1910). The MacGregor's name is at times misspelled as McGregor. The map of Corfu from 1876 shows the MacGregors lived across the street from the former Mills' home in Corfu.

**DEATH OF MRS. E. H. MILLS.**

**Event occurred in Brookton, Tompkins County—Interment at Corfu.**

Corfu, Dec 31.—The remains of Mrs. E. H. Mills of Brookton, Tompkins county, arrived here on the 4:26 p. m. train yesterday and were interred in Evergreen Hill Cemetery. The deceased was the wife of Edward H. Mills who was for many years a prominent merchant in this village who removed to Tompkins county sixteen years ago, re-engaging in mercantile pursuits, and where he has since resided.

Mrs. Mills was in usual health a week ago yesterday morning, but before night complained of a soreness in one of her fingers. Her daughter examined it and found what appeared to be a small splinter of wood, which she removed and which appeared to relieve her, but blood poisoning ensued and she continued to grow worse until Saturday, when death relieved her of her suffering. Her remains were accompanied by her husband and an only daughter, Emily Mills, who alone survive her and who possess the heartfelt sympathy of many friends in this vicinity who remember her as a kind friend and a devoted Christian whose sublime faith made her life beautiful and to the last degree exemplary.

Mr. Mills and daughter spent last night with Mr. and Mrs. W. W. McGregor and returned home this morning.
