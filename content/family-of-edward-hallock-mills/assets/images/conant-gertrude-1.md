    - Gertrude notes "Many people had kerosene lights then, and she sold it by the gallon. You took your container, and she filled it, usually with a potato on the end so it wouldn't spill." In a journal entry on 08 Feb 1923, George Jansen notes that he took "1 bin of potatoes" to "Miss Mills".

    - Dr. Benjamin Lockwood's house is present day 480 Brooktondale Road. Later, "Dr. Mary" Ridgway Tinker lived and practiced there for a time. Dr. Lockwood was also a member of Brookton Congregational Church, and he built the Dalebrook apartments on the foundation of the Grist Mill in the 1920's. After Dr. Lockwood's death, E. D. Shurter facilitated the placement of a plaque in Dr. Lockwood's honor outside Dalebrook that remains today.
  
    - The "woman who lived in and kept house" whose name Gertrude couldn't remember, is a reference to Ellen Gould.

    - Ralph Conant in personal correspondence 24 Jul 2021 identifies "Grandma Bacon" as Mary Louise (Vandemark) Bacon (1867-1950).

Emily Mills' store was in the building where the Post Office is today. I remember it as a dark place with long rows of counters on each side and tables and glass-topped counters in the middle. Emily Mills was a little woman, with her hair in a bun on top of her head, like Grandma Bacon's. She was quiet, neat, cheerful and always smiling.

She had yard goods, bias tape, combs, lace handerchiefs, and many things you could buy for presents for ten cents and up. There were racks of thread, needles, pins and all the things we needed for our 4-H projects.

She had groceries, and took butter and eggs in trade. Butter was weighed on her scales. The scales had a large scoop at one end, and little weights at the other. I don't remember her selling meat, but she probably did. Many people had kerosene lights then, and she sold it by the gallon. You took your container, and she filled it, usually with a potato on the end so it wouldn't spill. Marilyn and I would go do the shopping for Aunt Mina, with a cart in the Summer and a sled in the Winter to carry them home with.

Miss Mills also taught Sunday School at the Congregational Church and played the piano. It must have been a class for older people, as I never had her for a teacher. 

I remember her as very kind, and I was shocked to learn someone had stolen things from her while she was busy with another customer.

She lived across the street from Dr. Lockwood, in a little house that sat back near the hill. Her father had the store before her. Apparently she never married. She had a woman who lived in and kept house for and cooked the meals, and would stay in the store while she ate lunch and supper. I can't remember her name, but she looked a great deal like Miss Mills.

After Miss Mills died, Jessie (Shurter) Brewer had a notions store here. No groceries, just sewing supplies, hosiery and a few dresses, etc. She also had a lending library in the back, where I found many western and mystery stories to read. She ran the store for some time, and I always enjoyed shopping there and talking to her. She had a bell on the door, that rang next door so she could come over when she had customers.

Upstairs the building had a long hall, with a stage at one end. There were outside stairs leading to the second floor, but I had not noticed much about it, until a traveling show had a performance here. Many buildings in the village had such "halls".

Today the Postoffice is in this building and the upstairs is an apartment.
