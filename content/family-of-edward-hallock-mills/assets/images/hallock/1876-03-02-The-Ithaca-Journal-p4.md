  - "Bay is a hair coat color of horses, characterized by a reddish-brown or brown body color with a black point coloration on the mane, tail, ear edges, and lower legs. Bay is one of the most common coat colors in many horse breeds. The black areas of a bay horse's hair coat are called "black points", and without them, a horse is not a bay horse. Black points may sometimes be covered by white markings; however such markings do not alter a horse's classification as "bay". Bay horses have dark skin â€“ except under white markings, where the skin is pink." ([Bay (Horse)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_(horse), Wikipedia.org.)

Mr. W. B. Hallock, of Danby was in town to-day, driving a magnificent bay team of young horses, probably about six years old. Mr. H. is an expert in horseflesh, as a judge, trainer and fitter, and always has a stock of fine horses at this stables. The team on our streets to-day we understood is for sale.
