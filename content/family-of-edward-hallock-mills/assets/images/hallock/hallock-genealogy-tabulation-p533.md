PETER HALLOCK. The Original. d. 1.

Was born about 1600. Was probably an English Puritan, but his antecedents were unknown. 

According to a well authenticated legend, he landed at Southold, L. I., about 1640, with 12 others, all members of a Presbyterian Church in Hingham, Norfolk Co., England, about 100 miles N.E. of London. They were accompanied by Rev, John Youngs, their pastor, and immediately set up a church, naming the place Southold, apparently after a Southwold in their native land. 

Peter Hallock was accompanied later by his second wife, known as the Widow Howell. She had a son and a daughter by a former husband and he also had a son by a former wife. He promised her that if she would accompany him to this new world, her son should share equally with his in his estate. 

After landing in Southold he proceeded west and purchased a strip of land from the Indians in the western part of what is now Mattituck, reaching from the Sound to the Bay, about three and one-half miles, and about one-half mile wide. His wifeâ€™s son, Richard Howell, was settled on the west part of this strip, and his descendant, Elizabeth Howell, still occupies it. 

The old homestead was on the east part, and the farm is still held by his descendant, George Omar Hallock, the 9th generation from the original PETER. 

Peter Hallock had one son, William, who married Margaret Howell, daughter of the widow Howell, before she became the wife of Peter. As his mother was a former wife of Peter, they were not related. 

The widow's son, Richard, also married a daughter of William, thus effectually uniting the Hallocks and the Howells. 

The children of Richard and Elizabeth Howell were: John, Daniel, Richard, Jonathan, Isaac, Jacob, Hannah, and Dorothy, thus giving the Howells a fairly good start. 

The children of William and Margaret Hallock were: Thomas, Peter, William, and John, with daughters: Margaret, Martha, Sarah, Elizabeth, and Abigail. 

The four sons of William stand at the head of the four divisions of the Hallock descendants in which this genealogy is arranged. 

The burial place of Peter, and of his son, William, and grandsons, Thomas and Peter, is unknown,
