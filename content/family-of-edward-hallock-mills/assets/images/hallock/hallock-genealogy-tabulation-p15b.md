The first attempt to gather and set in order the descendants of PETER HALLOCK was the work of Rev. William A. Hallock, Senior Secretary of The American Tract Society. His “Hallock Ancestry” was published in 1866, and tabulated these descendants down to that date. He says of his work: 

“Having had the acquaintance of most of those whose testimony is here given, examined most of the wills, deeds and documents, visited the principal localities, ancient residents and graves, and carefully weighed the evidence in every case, I regard the main statements above as unquestionably reliable.” 

With the work of Dr. William A. Hallock as a starting point, his nephew, Charles Hallock, M.A., continued the investigation and tabulation and published his “Hallock Ancestry” in 1906. These two capable and painstaking workers have performed a service that would be impossible at this late day, and have built a trustworthy foundation upon which this somewhat imposing superstructure is erected. 

The work has extended itself beyond the anticipation of the writer and has practically absorbed his time and attention the past three years. It has necessitated the writing of more than 1000 letters, and tabulates the contributions of 300 co-workers. The friendly interest and encouraging words of these helpers is fully appreciated and thankfully acknowledged. An effort has been made to give credit in the sketches.
