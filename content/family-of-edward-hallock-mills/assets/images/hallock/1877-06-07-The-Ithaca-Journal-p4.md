â€”In our notice of the fire on Saturday last, by which the house of Mr. Hallock, in Danby, was partially consumed, we stated that it originated from a defective flue. Mr. Hallock assures us that such statement was erroneous, as the fire evidently caught on the outside of the roof near the eaves, and was caused by sparks from the chimney, a brisk fire of light wood having been just kindled. Mr. Hallock also wishes to return most hearty thanks to his neighbors for their prompt and timely assistance, which saved his house and its contents from entire destruction.
