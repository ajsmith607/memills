There is little doubt that the name of Peter Hallock, in England was HOLYOKE. He may have changed his name to facilitate his departure at a time when many were prevented from leaving by order of the King, and that upon arrival he continued this change of name which was variously spelled as found in documents and records of these early days. 

Quoting from the “Genealogical and Family History of the State of Connecticut,” by the Lewis Historical Publishing Co. of New York, the spelling of the name is given as: Holyeake, Holliok, Halliock, Halleck, Hollioak, Hallick, Hallack, Hollyoake, and Hallock, all diatonics of Holyoke. 

If there is any doubt as to the authenticity of PETER, the father of us all, the continual recurrence of this name in the early generations is an abiding evidence of the existence of an ancestor of that name who walked about in the flesh, and was known to them. It occurs 22 times in our records of these early generations.
