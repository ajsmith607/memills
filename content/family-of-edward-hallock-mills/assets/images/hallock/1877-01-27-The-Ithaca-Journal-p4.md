Valuable Mule Instantly Killed on State Street.

About two o'clock this afternoon a singular accident occurred at the corner of State and Tioga streets, by which Wm. G. Hallock, of Danby, lost a valuable mule. A man, whose name we did not learn, was driving east on State street, a sleigh load of coal, and from the rear of the sleigh a bar of Swede iron, three-quarters of an inch square, and with a beveled end, projected. A son of Mr. Hallock was driving a team of mules at a smart pace behind this sleigh, and when just at the Tioga street crossing, the sleigh ahead came to a stop suddenly, the bar of iron entering the breast of one of the mules to a distance of two feet perhaps, the animal falling dead in its tracks. A large throng is gathered about the body of the animal which is still lying in the street as we go to press.
