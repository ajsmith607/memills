HALLOCK—HOLYOKE 

It is a curious fact that this most circumstantial and apparently incontrovertible story should now be discredited, after it has stood for more than two centuries and a half, by historians who once labored to establish its authenticity. It is even asserted that there was no Peter Hallock; and, indeed his name cannot be found on the passenger lists of colonists migrating to America in 1632-8, as given in the Mass. Hist. Collections. Whittaker himself, whose “History of Southold” is in the Long Island Historical Society's library, says in a note to the author of these lines: 

“T repeated to your uncle, who compiled the Hallock Ancestry, the story which I had heard respecting Peter Hallock, and which is published in ‘Griffins Journal’. I now know that the story is untrue. There is not a particle of evidence to be found that Peter Hallock was ever here.” 

But who was? Who was the historical man? Who was the Father of William, whose record is admitted to be “clear and accurate”, as stated. by his acts, and will of 1682? That will is signed William Hallock, but the copyist, whose rescript is of record, has inadvertantly subscribed it Holyoake, a noticeable departure from the original Holyoke. Recognising these Discrepancies in the spelling, which are conspicuous on gravestones and legal documents along the family line for the preceding forty years, the logical conclusion would be that well authenticated facts of long standing, and always accepted as historical data, have simply been overlaid by a mirage resulting from a distortion and interchange of family patronimics. 

If Hallock is not a diatonic of Holyoke, whence and how did it originate? It is not common in England today, and is not’of record at Yarmouth or Hingham whence Rev. Youngs and his company migrated. 

The name Holyoke has been known in England for centuries, and there is a family coat of arms. One Edward Holyoke migrated from Stafford Co. in 1639, and was afterward President of Harvard College. His son Elizur Holyoke became well known in Northwestern Massachusetts in 1654 from having received a grant of land near Northampton ; and Mt. Holyoke is named for him because he camped at its base while land looking. The family arms appear in his will (1711). He had a son Edward Augustus, who lived to be nearly 100 years old.
