–The house of Mr. W. B. Hallock, near Danby village, was considerably damaged by fire between eight and nine o’clock this morning. The flames originated from a defective flue and the roof and upper portion of the building were badly burned before the neighbors, who nobly rallied to the aid of Mr. Hallock, could by the use of pails of water quench the fire. Nothing but active, determined effort saved the house from complete destruction. Mr. Hallock is secured against loss by a policy in the Danby Insurance Company.
