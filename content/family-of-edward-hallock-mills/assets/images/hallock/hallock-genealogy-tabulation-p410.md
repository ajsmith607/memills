JOHN HALLOCK. J. 3. William 2. Peter 1. d. 18. 

Was son of William and Margaret-Hallock. Was born about 1658 and died 1737 at Setauket, L. I. Married Abigail Swazey about 1678, She died Jan. 23, 1737. Children: 

1. John, 2d, born 1679.* 

2. Peter, born 1689.* 

3. William, born 1695.* 

4. Mary-Willets, born 1696.* 

5. Jonathan, born 1698.* 

6. Benjamin, born about 1700.* 

Of the 10 daughters of John and Abigail we have the name of only one. Four Willets brothers, sons of Thomas and Dinah-Willets, of Syosset, L. I., married five of these sisters, as follows, but we do not know the names of four of them: 

Richard Willets married, first, a daughter, and, second, the widow of John Powell, who was another daughter. 

Amos Willets married daughter Mary about 1717.* He married again, Rebecca Whitson, 

Thomas Willets married a daughter. 

Isaac Willets married a daughter. 

The controlling influence in this interesting incident seems to have been that they were all good honest Quakers. John Hallock and his wife, Abigail, were active members of the Society of Friends, much to the displeasure of his father, William, who gave vent to this displeasure in his will. They settled at Setauket, L. L, in Brookhaven Town. Their graves are marked by small stones, rising little above the ground in the Friends corner.
