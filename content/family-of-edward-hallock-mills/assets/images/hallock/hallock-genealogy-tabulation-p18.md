THE HOLYOKE-HALLOCK ARMS 

ARMS: Azure, a chevron, argent, coticed, or, between three crescents of the second. 

CREST: A crescent, argent. 

(Another crest is a cubic arm erect, habited gules cuffed argent, holding in the hand proper an oak branch fruited or)

We conclude that the Holyoke Arms, as they appear upon this page, can be honorably appropriated by descendants of the original PETER HALLOCK who are interested in the subject of Heraldry, and desire to adopt a Crest for family use. They appear in the will of Elizur in 1711. He was son of Edward Holyoke who migrated from Stafford county in 1639 and was afterward President of Harvard College. He became well known in Northwestern Massachusetts in 1654 from having received a grant of land near Northampton as stated heretofore.
