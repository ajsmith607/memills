Of the four branches into which the descendants of PETER HALLOCK are divided in this work, it may be said that the THOMAS branch is found largely in Mattituck and Northville, L. I. The PETER branch contains many notable persons, including Gen. Henry Wager Halleck. They settled in Mattituck, and from there to the south side of the Island, and are found all over the land, some being missionaries in China. 

The WILLIAM branch is the least prolific. Their original home was largely in Cutchogue and Southold. 

The JOHN branch is the most prolific and contains a large number of Quakers, or Friends. They settled in and about Setauket, L. I, but like the other branches they have undertaken to explore the land, and are found in large numbers in the region of the Hudson River, and in the West. 

Our ancestors were undoubtedly of Puritan stock and strongly religious in their beliefs and practices. 

They had a strong aversion to the formalism of the Protestant Church of their native land, which was an integral part of the State, and the simplicity of their public worship was carried to an extreme. It is needless to observe that the swing of the pendulum has returned, and ritual and formal observances are again coming into their own.
