  - [William Josiah Paine Foote](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/84692401/william_josiah_paine_foote) (14 Jun 1834 to 23 Sep 1922) was the proprietor of Foote & Co. florists, originally at 15 East Green Street (his wife [Adelia (Coe) Foote](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/84691637/adelia_foote) (15 Jul 1844 to 24 Jul 1918) operated a second location of the business at 5 East Green Street) and then at 314 East State Street, Ithaca NY, in the location where the Strand would later be built in 1916 and demolished in 1993. When the Strand Theatre Corporation of Ithaca officially formed on 17 Mar 1916 (Tompkins County Clerk, Ithaca NY), one of the initial eight directors was Frederick E. Bates, formerly of Brookton, who was a former part owner of the lower grist mill in Brookton that is presently Dalebrook, and at the time of the Strand's formation, he was the newly elected Mayor of Ithaca. The Strand was for many years Ithaca's main event venue after the Lyceum Theatre closed in 1927. Foote & Co.'s main competitor for many years was The Bool Flora Co., started in 1894. As I write this, Bool's Flower Shop is still in business in Ithaca at 209 North Aurora Street.

  - W.J.P. Foote's sons are [Issac Newton "Newton" Foote](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/238381391/issac_newton_foote) (Jan 1861 to 14 Mar 1945), who eventually moved downstate, and [John E. Foote](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/110786246/john_e_foote) (07 Jul 1866 to 1930), who eventually moved to Geneva and ultimately, Canandaigua. (In the 1870 Unites States Federal Cenus, the family of W.J.P. Foote lived in Waterloo, postoffice in Tyre.)
  
  - In the same newspaper the following day, Ithaca Justice of the Peace [Spence Spencer](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/46570453/spence-spencer) (17 Oct 1825 to 24 Jun 1894) gave a fuller account of the circumstances of John Foote's marriage, which is referred to as "The Foote-Boom Wedding". (29 Jan 1889, Ithaca Daily Journal, Ithaca NY, p3, q43.) This wedding that happened "last spring" was recorded as 19 Jun 1888 in Ithaca NY, John E. Foote married Sophia Boom. (New York State Marriage Index, New York State Department of Health, Albany NY, n9535, ancestry.com.) [Sophia E. (Lee) Boom Foote](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/44809539/sophia-e-foote) (? to 20 Oct 1898) had had fraternal twins with her first husband [John Henry Boom](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/41796385/john_henry_boom) (05 Aug 1845 to 15 Jul 1878), and they were 14 years old when their mother married Foote. Sophia's son [Elmer Eugene Boom](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/41796300/elmer_eugene_boom) (1875 to 15 Nov 1891) died a few years later at 16 years old, and in the 1892 New York State Census for Ithaca NY, Sophia and daughter Emma ([Emma Jane (Boom) Coon Lee](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/188227328/emma_jane_lee) (1875 to 17 Jan 1914)) are living apart from John, and in the final months of her life, Sophia is living at 114 West Mill Street in Ithaca, while John is working and boarding at his father's flower shop and home at 15 East Green Street, Ithaca. (Ithaca New York City Directory, 1898, p136, ancestry.com.) As early as the 1892 census, Sophia was using the last name "Boom". Eugene and Emma appear to be fraternal twins, but different sources give different birthdates in 1875.

  - 15 Feb 1899, John E. Foote  married [Florence May (Condit) Foote](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/110786299/florence_may_foote) (15 Feb 1875 to 14 Nov 1960), who was the same approximate age as Sophia's children. (*Genealogical Record of the Condit Family*, p408, ancestry.com) They had three children, the first born in 09 Oct 1900. John appears in the 1909 Geneva New York, City Directory (p98, ancestry.com) working as a machinist at Standard Optical Company. His family moved to Canandaigua in the last four years of his life, where "he conducted a general store and made many friends". (09 Dec 1930, Daily Messenger, Canandaigua NY, p2, q32.)

JOHN FOOTE IN JAIL.
 
CHARGED WITH A SERIOUS CRIME-HIS SINGULAR CAREER.

E. H. Mills, postmaster at Brookton appeared before U.S. Commissioner Van Cleef last Friday and entered a complaint against John Foote, charging him with stealing a registered letter containing $50 in cash, a note and checks for $90. A warrant for Foote's arrest was placed in Deputy Marshal Norton's hands and he went to Caroline Depot on Saturday morning. He found that the accused had come to this city and returning here the officer arrested Foote about 5 o'clock in the afternoon and placed him in jail.

FOOT'S CHECKERED CAREER.

John Foote is about 22 years of age. He is the younger son of W.J.P. Foote the florist of this city, and up to eighteen months ago the young man was as highly respected as any youth in Ithaca, but within the period mentioned he has been implicated in two or three questionable scrapes and his conduct has been such as to cause his friends to question his sanity.

Without any apparent cause young Foote threw up a clerkship at Jackson & Bush's store and during the summer spent time idly cruising about the lake in a steam launch which he had purchased. Later Foote was given a place at Sherwood's store where he learned the business of shirt cutting. He was liked by his employer, as he proved an apt apprentice and skillful workman. But after remaining about a year with Mr. Sherwood Foote suddenly left town and it was rumored that he did so to avoid the consequences of speculations. He afterwards made restitution from a small legacy bequeathed him by a relative and for a time nothing more was heard of him and last spring his friends were shocked to learn that he had married a woman of this town. The wedding took place at the office of Justice Spencer and Foote afterwards declared that he was drunk and insensible when he assumed the marriage vows.

A few days after they were married Foote and his wife went to Binghamton. The wife soon returned alone stating that she had let him have her purse containing $125, with which he skipped. After getting the woman's money, Foote went to New York where he boarded a steamer for Cuba. At that place he was attacked with yellow fever and was thrown into a hospital. Recovering from the fever in about four weeks he found himself destitute of clothing and penniless, the authorities having burned his garments and appropriated his money. He secured enough clothing to cover him and obtaining work as a cabin boy on a vessel made his way back to New York. From that city he tramped to Poughkeepsie. At the latter place the great bridge was in course of construction over the Hudson, and the builder, wanting a man to do some painting on a particularly dangerous portion of it Foote, who said he did not care what became of him, got into the sling and was hauled aloft to the perilous place and did the work. He received three dollars for the dob. Taking to the road again, he tramped to the vicinity of Rochester, where he engaged to a farmer to cut thirty acres of corn at a dollar an acre. While at this job he learned of a chance to get work in an iron pipe establishment at Youngstown, Ohio. He went to that place and remained there until November. On Thanksgiving day a man wearing a ragged greasy coat, old overhauls and hobnailed brogans entered the store of Al. Merrill at Caroline Depot. Newton Foote, a clerk in that store recognized the rough-clad person as his brother John. The wanderer was kindly received and given employment and a home.

Matters proceeded smoothly until last week when the mail pouch from Brookton was robbed. The mail from Brookton is opened at Caroline Depot and rearranged. Foote had access to the key of the pouch and when assorting the contents he found a registered letter which he is accused of appropriating. This letter contained the cash and papers alluded to at the beginning of this article. Foote destroyed the note and check and putting the cash in his pocket came to Ithaca Friday and was found in a drunken sleep at the rooms to Torrent Hose No. 5. 

A DENIAL

When Foote was charged with the theft he denied it and declared he had no recollection of the matter. While he was in this city, however, he displayed a roll of money containing ten and five dollar bills, and the friend who took him home said Foote had about $48 after he became intoxicated. A search for the missing money disclosed it wrapped in paper and immersed in the center of a jar of preserves.

The young man has retained J.H. Tichenor as his counsel. His examination before Commissioner Van Cleef is set down for Thursday of this week. 

The friends of the accused say that there are many things in his history of the past two years which point to the unsoundness of his mind. They assert that no sane person could have acted as he has done and they think he should be cared for as one irresponsible for his acts.
