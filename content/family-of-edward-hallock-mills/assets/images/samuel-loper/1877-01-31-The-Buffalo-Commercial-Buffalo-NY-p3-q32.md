Inquest Concluded. 

Coroner Scott last evening concluded his inquest in the case of Mrs. Margaret Moran, run over and killed on Court Street, on Saturday, 20th inst. The witnesses were Francis Walsh and Burrell T. Milford. Their testimony did not change the aspect of the case, and the jury rendered the following verdict: 

That the said Margaret Moran came to her death on the 20th day of January, 1877, on the corner of Court and Wilkeson streets by being run over by a team, driven by Samuel W. Loper; and we find that the same was caused by accident and not otherwise.
