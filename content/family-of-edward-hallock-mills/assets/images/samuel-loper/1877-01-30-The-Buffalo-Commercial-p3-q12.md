CORONER'S INVESTIGATION. 

Inquest in the Case of Margaret Moran—Statement of Samuel W. Loper, &c.  

Coroner Scott commenced an inquest at his office on Main Street last evening; in the case of the old lady Mrs. Margaret Moran, the particulars of whose death, on Saturday afternoon, 20th inst., by being run over on Court Street, have already been given. The jury was composed as follows: Alfred.D. Daw, George Wolbert, James Day, Patrick English, William Gough, August Lilia, George Rozier, George S. Diedrich.

THE TESTIMONY.

The first witness called was Dr. Wm. V. Miller, who made the *post mortem* examination. He was of the opinion that death resulted from the shock to the nervous system, the injuries inflicted not being sufficient in themselves to kill. No fractures were discovered. 

The next witness was Peter O’Connor, who testified substantially as follows: 

I was coming down Wilkeson Street near Seventh Street; saw the team that ran over the woman; they were going at a slow trotting pace; they were then about one hundred feet from where the accident happened; I had them in view all the time; was crossing Sixth Street when the team struck the woman; the first I noticed of the occurrence was that the horses were walking over the prostrate form of the deceased; the first bob of the sleigh struck her and went over her body; was present when she was picked up and helped raise the sleigh off her body; she was apparently dead; the man, in my opinion, was driving quietly along; she was run over on the street about four feet from the sidewalk; assisted in carrying her into the house; I asked the driver how it was he ran over the woman; he said he never saw her until the team had gone over her; he then drove away toward the starch-factory. 

Delia Moran, a grand-daughter of the deceased, gave the following testimony: 

I am seventeen years of age; reside at No. 253 Court Street; was sitting by a window in the front portion of our house; saw a double team and a sleigh drawn by a single horse, coming down Court Street near Wilkeson Street; my grandmother was coming across the street from a grocery-store and had got between the two teams When I first noticed her; the teams were about ten feet apart; my grandmother seemed to hurrying to get by the single horse; the single horse was going slow and the double team fast; they were opposite to one another at the place where the accident occurred; my grandmother was 89 years of age and short-sighted.

Ellen Moran was called, and testified that the eyesight of the deceased was good; that she often went to the grocery, and was in the habit of going to church every Sunday. 

STATEMENT OF SAMUEL W. LOPER. 

Samuel W. Loper, the person owning and driving the team by which Mrs. Moran was run over, was put upon the stand and made the following statement: 

I am a farmer; reside in the town of Alden, Erie County; am 54 years of age; I was driving down Court Street on the 20th inst., with a team of horses attached to a pair of light bobs; at the crossing of Wilkeson Street I saw a woman attempting to pass in front of the horses, about four or six feet ahead of them; discovered her just as she came in front of the nigh horse; I pulled on the reins and called “Whoa” to the horses; they threw up their heads somewhat frightened, settled back, and tried to stop; before they could be stopped the pole struck her (Mrs, Moran), knocking her down. The horses spread apart and passed over her form without touching her; the right hand runner of the forward bob passed over her limbs above the knee, apparently, and by the time the hind bobs reached her, the horses had been brought to a standstill; I backed them up a little and raised up the sleigh, picked up the woman; myself and a young man carried her into the house, took her up stairs, and laid her on the bed; the women present commenced to take off her clothes, and Mrs. Ellen Moran told me to go and look after my team; went down to the starch-factory, got a load of feed and went home. I had no conversation with any one touching the accident; did not leave my address; promised to stop on my way, back from the factory; did not do so, Mr. Wolfe and others about there knew me; did not wish to stop for fear of being detained in the city over Sunday with my team by some officer; thought it better to go home and come back the next day; did think once of leaving my address; did not go away for fear of any consequences, but left under the impression that I was known and if wanted could be easily found. The one-horse rig was going down on the left hand side of the street about ten or twelve feet from me, being directly opposite and abreast of me; did not see the deceased until she was almost before my horses; thought she was dead when I picked her up; think she breathed once or twice. Three little boyes [sic] were in the sleigh passing down the street in the same direction that I was going; my sleigh was empty; I was driving about ten feet from the accident; the horses stopped within probably twelve feet of where she was struck by the pole; the only thing that could have prevented my seeing her sooner, was the other sleigh; have no distinct recollection as to whether I was looking down Court Street all the time or not; I was perfectly sober. 

The statement of Mr. Loper was mainly corroborated by that of other witnesses called: The inquest was adjourned till this evening, when it will be concluded.
