  - [Orsamus Warren](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/180634786/orsamus-warren) (07 Jun 1800 to 16 Feb 1876). Orsamus is the father of James Dunlap Warren who married [Mary Smith (Mills) Warren](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/113110177/mary_smith-warren) (19 Jun 1831 to 06 Apr 1894), a first cousin once removed of Edward H. Mills, as Mary Warren's father William and Edward's father Jonas are first cousins. The Warrens are explored in the section: {{% pagelink "buffalo-mills" %}}.

  - [Samuel W. Loper](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/54496703/samuel-w-loper) (10 Aug 1822 to 12 Mar 1898). Samuel Loper is the brother of [Elmira Jane (Loper) Pine](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199952046/elmira-j-pine) (1813 to 07 Mar 1890) who married [Charles Mills Pine](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199952123/charles-m-pine) (1812 to 08 Oct 1897), Edward Mills' brother-in-law and mentor in the grocery business in Staten Island and business partner in E. H. Mills & Co. in Corfu and Mott's Corners.

  - After brief research, I concluded that [Abram C. Bodine](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/40962860/abram-c-bodine) (14 Nov 1802 to 16 Nov 1894) is likely unrelated to the Bodines that lived in Castleton Staten Island at this time, and attended the Dutch Reformed Church of Port Richmond, which the Pines and Mills also attended. (See for example [Abram B. Bodine](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/179169473/abram-b-bodine) (Jan 1816 to 02 Jan 1895), who on the 1874 Beers map of Staten Island owns a dry goods store across the street from Pine's store, and according to 1877, J.J. Clute, *Annals of Staten Island* (1877), he was the first of the Bodines.)
