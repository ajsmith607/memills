There is Money in Peddling.–A man calling himself James Reighnolds went to Townline a few weeks since and persuaded a farmer named Samuel Loper to believe a heap of money could be made by peddling small wares. He borrowed $25 from the yeoman and a horse and wagon, and drove to LeRoy, leaving Loper in the belief that “there’s money in peddling.” Well, perhaps there is, but in this case Mr. Loper did not perceive any. The team was found at LeRoy a few days after, with a large bill attached to it for keeping. Reignolds came to this city and settled down at shoemaking for Forbush & Brown, where he made the acquaintance of a sanguine young man to whom he opened his favorite theme–”there’s money in peddling.” The new victim advanced sixteen dollars and the traveling merchant set out for Canada with a load of Yankee notions, intending to purchase produce in return. He never made any return to his partner and he was arrested on a charge of false pretences and locked up.
