Run Over and Killed. 

Yesterday afternoon between four and five o'clock Mrs. Margaret Moran was run over by a farmerâ€™s sleigh at the corner of Court and Wilkeson streets. She was picked up and taken to the house of her son, Timothy Moran, 253 Court street, but died before she could be got to her room. Dr. Pattison was called, but Mrs. Moran was dead before he arrived. She was eighty-nine years of age. The blame seems to rest upon the driver of the sleigh, and it is probable that he will suffer for his carelessness.
