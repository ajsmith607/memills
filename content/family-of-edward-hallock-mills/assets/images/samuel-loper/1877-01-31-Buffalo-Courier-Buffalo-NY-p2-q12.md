The Case of Margaret Moran—A Verdict of Death by Accident. 

Pursuant to adjournment the inquest in the case of Margaret Moran, who was run over and killed on the 20th inst., by the team of a farmer named Samuel W. Loper, of the town of Alden, was resumed last evening by Coroner Scott, at his office. Only two additional witnesses were examined, their testimony being as follows. 

STATEMENT OF FRANCIS WALSH. 

Reside at No. 21 Fifth street; am 13 years old; the first I saw of the accident was the deceased coming from Daney’s grocery store; there was a double team coming down Court street and also a single horse sleigh right abreast of one another; could not say  whether she was coming or going from the store, but think she was coming from Daney’s; she was hurrying to get by the single horse and had got by and kept on her way across the street; she was run over by the double team; the pole of the sleigh struck her in the breast and knocked her down; the team stepped over her without touching her, the first bob of the sleigh passing over her head and ankles; heard some one holler “whoa” to the driver two or three times; the driver checked his horses as quick as he could, then jumped out of his sleigh and tried to pull her from under; he could not pull her out so he lifted up one side of the sleigh with Mr. Wolfe, got the woman out and sat her on the snow, he having hold of her all the time, he then helped to carry her in the house; noticed the team when coming down Court street; they were not going fast; there were boys on the sleigh; the team struck the woman about eight feet from the crosswalk; they did not drag her body after she went down; did not notice any carelessness on the part of the driver; was standing on the corner of Wilkeson and Court streets and about twenty-five feet from where the accident happened. 

STATEMENT OF BURRELL T. MILLFORD. 

1 am 13 years old, and reside at 247 Court street; was in the house reading; hearing a noise, looked out and saw Mr. Wolfe and another man holding a sleigh up; the driver was taking a woman from under the sleigh; went out and saw they had Margaret Moran sitting on the snow; think she breathed once or twice while sitting up; the driver and a man named Maroney helped to carry her into the house: the driver came out, got in his sleigh and was asked by Mr. Wolfe if be was coming back; he said he was; he did not come back to my knowledge; the accident happened about six or eight feet above the crosswalk; there was blood upon the woman's face when taken from under the sleigh. 

At this point the case was given to the jury, who, after brief consultation, returned the following 

VERDICT. 

That the said Margaret Moran came to her death on the 20th day of January, 1877, on the corner of Court and Wilkeson streets by being run over by a team, driven by Samuel W. Loper and we find that the same was caused by accident and not otherwise.
