    This seems to be the page and entry that Molly Adams mistook for a reference to Emily in "Town of Caroline" Chapter Two of <em>The Towns of Tompkins County</em>, Jane Marsh Dieckmann editor, 1998, p61-62: "From 1908 to 1925 an itinerant worker named George Jansen, who dug gardens, painted rooms or houses, washed dishes, or "kept house" when an owner went on a trip, recorded events in Brookton along with the daily weather. He noted the death of Emily Mills, who had continued her father's store for thirty years, extending credit to many needy individuals." George passed nearly two years before Emily.
