**New Pastor at Lyons Falls.** 

Edward W. Robinson, of Auburn Seminary, has been unanimously called to the pastorate of Forest Presbyterian church at Lyons Falls, and will probably accept the call soon. 

Mr. Robinson, a member of the senior class, is a graduate of Hamilton College with the class of 1910. His first year in college was spent at Cornell University, the remaining three at Hamilton. After completing his course, he went to Auburn, entering the seminary with the present class in 1910. During part of his college course he supplied the Presbyterian church at Kirkland, near Clinton, also at Oriskany. During his junior year Mr. Robinson preached at the Congregational church at Brookton, and the present year has been the pulpit supply at Red Creek. 

The last two pastors of Forest church have been Auburn men. Rev. William C. Spicer, of the class of 1896, now pastor of the First Presbyterian: church of Gloversville, went to the charge directly from the seminary, and remained there eleven years, accepting the Gloversville charge in 1908. Charles W. Kittridge for the past six years pastor of the church, was a member of the class of 1900.
