SUPERVISORS SHOULD ACT 

Anti-Tuberculosis Meeting Held at Lyons Falls—Addressed by Drs. Parrish and Robinson. 

Strong addresses on the unchecked ravages of the great white plague in this section and the urgent need of a tuberculosis hospital for Lewis county, were made by Dr. D. D. Parrish, health officer, and Dr. Anna Robinson, of Lyons Falls, to a large congregation in Forest church in the above village last Sunday. 

Dr. Parrish spoke of the reduction of tuberculosis by preventive measures in various nations and this country. He said that the death rate was proportionately lower in New York city, where conditions were naturally more adverse to health, than in the rural districts, because of greater vigilance and hospital care in the city. Dr. Parrish mentioned the fact that the disease is most common between the ages of 20 and 30 years, striking down young people in their prime, when they are of the most use to the world. He strongly urged isolation and sanitorium care for tubercular patients. 

Dr. Robinson, who was formerly with the board of health in New York city, quoted the slogan of the department, “Public health is purchasable. Within rational limits any community can determine its own death rate.” Dr. Robinson dwelt on the great increase in measures and institutions for the prevention of tuberculosis and its cure and the marvelous results produced by sanitorium treatment, “The force of nurses for tubercular work has been increased from 16 to 160 and tubercular clinics established all over the city.” Two great advantages of hospital treatment are: First—Patients learn the vital importance of protecting other people from the disease; Second—The possibility of cure. “The means of prevention,” said Dr. Robinson, lies in your hands and that necessitates the establishment of a tuberculosis hospital in Lewis county. Every person should write a letter to his or her local supervisor or to the clerk or chairman of the board, strongly urging the establishment of such a hospital." 

Rev. Edward Robinson, pastor of the church, read a letter from Miss McKechnie, the nurse who investigated for the Committee on Tuberculosis in Lewis county, stating that she had discovered 38 cases of the disease that had been positively diagnosed by the doctors and 61 other suspicious cases and that “hospital care is the only solution for the sadly neglected, desperately ill people, who have been brought to despondency and want by this sickness.” Mr. Robinson said “it would be little short of criminal on the part of the board of supervisors to reject the proposition to establish a county tuberculosis hospital.”
