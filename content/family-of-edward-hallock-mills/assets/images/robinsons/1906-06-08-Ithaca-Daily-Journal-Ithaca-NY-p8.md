Interesting Memorial Day exercises were held in the Congregational Church last Wednesday. Addresses were made by Rev. A. B. Woodworth and Rev. James R. Robinson. Several recitations were given by the school children, and the choir sang appropriate selections. A large attendance enjoyed the exercises.
