Rev. Edward Robinson, pastor-elect of Forest church, arrived here Saturday. He was accompanied by his mother and a friend. 

Edward W. Robinson, of the senior class of the Auburn Theological Seminary, having received a call to the pastorate of the Forest Presbyterian church and accepted the same, entered upon his duties Sunday, May 4th. Forest church has become attached to men from the Auburn seminary, having had two successful pastors from that institution. The Rev. W. C. Spicer of the class of 1896, now pastor of the First Presbyterian church of Gloversville, came to Lyons Falls directly from the seminary and remained eleven years, going to his second pastorate in Gloversville in 1907. During Mr. Spicer’s connection with the church the work was extended until three out-stations became part of the parish. The Rev. Charles F. Kittredge of the class of 1900, succeeded Mr. Spicer and for six years has labored in this large field and has also greatly endeared himself to a loyal people, who are loath to be separated from this pastor and his family. However, the best wishes of the church membership and the community go with them to the pastorate of the Presbyterian church at Whitesboro. It is with pleasure that we welcome as Mr. Kittredge’s successor another Auburn man, who is a son and grandson of Presbyterian clergy. He is a graduate of Hamilton College with the class of 1910. His first year in college was spent at Cornell University, but feeling that Hamilton College offered better facilities for the preparation for the ministry, Mr. Robinson spent the remaining three years there. Immediately after his graduation, he went to Auburn, entering with the present senior class in 1910. During part of his college course he supplied the Presbyterian church at Kirkland, near Clinton, N. Y. During his junior year Mr. Robinson preached at the Congregational church at Brookton, N. Y., and has been the pulpit supply at Red Creek, during the present year. His summer vacations have been spent in practical pastoral work and he leaves the seminary well equipped to grapple with the problems that usually present themselves to a new pastor.
