FOREST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH 

Rev. Edw. W. Robinson, Pastor. 

Rev. Edward Robinson will ex change pulpits with Rev. T. F. Jessup of Boonville next Sunday. As that day is National Tuberculosis Day, when it is customary for ministers to preach on the evil of the disease, Mr. Robinson announced that the addresses on tuberculosis were to be given this Sunday so as to inform the people of his parish.
