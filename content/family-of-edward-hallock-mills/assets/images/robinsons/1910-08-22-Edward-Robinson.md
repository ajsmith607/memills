R. L. Denman was elected chairman. About 20 members were present. After singing, and a prayer by Dea. Kinney, Chas Personius made some remarks as to our need of a minister, and said that Rev. Edward Robinson was available for a supply. Mrs. Lockwood, Mr. Kinney, Mr. and Mrs. Mason and Mrs. Spaulding spoke in respect to supplies and settled pastors. The consensus of opinion seemed to be in favor of a pastor in our midst to labor with us and for [obscured by binding] but it was not thought possible to support one.

There was much desultory talk, but nothing arrived at. Finally Mr. Personius moved that we engage Rev. Edward Robinson for the fall. The motion was seconded, voted upon and carried. The meeting then adjourned.
