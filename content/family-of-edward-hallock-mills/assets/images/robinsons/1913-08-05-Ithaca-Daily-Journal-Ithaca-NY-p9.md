TWO ARE INJURED OUT AT BROOKTON

Melvin Lynch’s Eye Struck by a Chip and Mrs. Preston Has a Fall

Brookten, Aug. 5—Melvin Lynch while chopping wood was struck in the eye by a flying chip which came near putting the eye out entirely. A blood clot formed destroying the sight for a little time. At present writing it is much better.
