LAY CORNERSTONE FOR NEW CHURCH

Maple Park Congregationalists Hold Interesting Service in Fast-Growing Section.

THE REV. L, T. REED OFFICIATES. 

Church is Prosperous After Three Years Hard Workâ€”New Pastor in Charge. 

The culmination of three years earnest endeavor was brought about yesterday afternoon, when the cornerstone of the new Mapleton Park Congregational Church, located at Sixty-fifth street and Eighteenth avenue, was laid, in the presence of over a hundred members of the congregation and their friends. The ceremony, of laying the cornerstone was performed by the Rey. L. T. Reed, pastor of the Flatbush Congregational Church, corner of East Highteenth street and Dorchester Road. 

Within the cornerstone itself is to be placed a box containing the names of the present members of the congregation, of those who contributed to the building fund of the church, and also of the children in the Sunday school. 

On the decorated platform with the Rev. Mr. Reed were the Rev. E. R. Hanse of the Borough Park Congregational Church and the Rey. Edward Weeks Robinson, the minister of the Mapleton Park Church. Mr. Hanse offered a prayer for the speedy completion of the new edifice, and Mr. Robinson read the service. 

Mr. Robinson was installed as minister on May 16, being successor to the Rev. Robert Goldsmith, who had received an appointment to Wisconsin University. He is a graduate of Hamilton College, '10, and Auburn Seminary, '13, being formerly pastor of the Presbyterian Church at Lyons Falls, N. Y. He is a fine speaker, and is very earnest in his endeavor to build up a large congregation. He is married, and lives at 1818 Seventy-first street. 

The organization started three years ago as a Sunday school, in a vacant house, and through the hard work and loyal support of its members has grown with such rapidity that it now boasts of the largest Sunday school membership in the vicinity. Through the new subway extension the neighborhood is rapidly increasing in population, and everything points to the development of an excellent church organization. 

Ground was first broken for the new building on March 15, but long before that time the zealous members of the new congregation were at work raising funds for the erection of the new edifice. The foundation is now completed and the cornerstone laid, and work on the building itself will begin shortly. On the evenings of June 18, 19 and 21 a fair will be held on the grounds, the proceeds of which will be added to the building fund. 

The present officers of the church organization are: Trustees, W. K. Seeler, F. Van Winkle and William Beyer; clerk, J. W. McQuarrie; treasurer, George Crapullo; financial secretary, T. J. Atgate. The architect for the new building is Fred H. Seeler.
