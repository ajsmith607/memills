Edward Robinson, a senior from Auburn Seminary, who occupied the pulpit at Forest church, last Sunday morning and evening, was greeted with large audiences. His text the morning was from Job 14:14, “If a man dies shall he live again?” and in the evening, Acts 3:19. He also gave some interesting remarks at the Christian Endeavor meeting.
