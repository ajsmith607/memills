  - Albert Landon's father was [Sextus Barnes Landon](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/63631163/sextus-barnes-landon) (20 Apr 1834 to 24 May 1925) and wife [Abigail "Abbie" (Keeler) Landon](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/63631222/abigail-landon) (20 Oct 1836 to 30 Mar 1909), both of whom were charter members of the church.

  - Jane Elizabeth Tupper is [Jane "Jennie" Elizabeth (Tupper) Hutchings](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/22110357/jennie-elizabeth-hutchings) (1880 to 31 Aug 1946). Before her association with the Robinson's, she was "Miss Jennie Tupper" the primary schoolteacher in West Danby, where she originally knew Roscoe Tupper. In 1909 she is in Weston NY under that name and mentioned alongside the Robinsons (see 11 Aug 1909, Dundee Observer, Dundee NY, p8, nyshistoricnewspapers.org). During that time, Reverend James R. Robinson was pastor at Tyrone Presbyterian Church in Weston NY. The 1910 federal census shows her living with the Robinsons in Brookton as "Jane E. Tupper" with "companion" as relation to head. Her marriage licence to Roscoe Tupper in 1922 lists her name as "Jeanne E. Tupper". In the 1930 Federal census for Danby District 0003, she lists her name as "Jane". Jennie and Roscoe did not have children. After Reverend James Robinson's death, Jennie appears to continue living and traveling with Lydia for a time.
