LYONS FALLS:

Ordained to the Ministry.
 
Rev. Edward: W. Robinson was ordained to the Presbyterian ministry and installed as pastor of Forest Presbyterian church of this village, last Friday evening. The services were very impressive and were as follows: Organ prelude by Miss Florence Talcott, followed by the hymn “All People That on Earth Do Dwell,” by choir and congregation. The scriptures were read by Rev. Henry White of Clinton and Rev. T. F. Jessup of Boonville offered prayer. After the hymn, “The Church's One Foundation,” the sermon was preached by Rev. W. C. Spicer of Gloversville, a former pastor of Forest church. It was an able and interesting discourse and was listened to with intense interest. “I Love Thy Kingdom, Lord,” was sung after which the service of ordination and installation was held. The constitutional questions to the pastor and people were put by Rev. John M. Brockie of Holland Patent, former moderator of the Utica Presbytery, who presided at the services. Rev. Mr. Jessup gave the prayer of ordination and installation and the charge to the pastor was given by Rey. Arthur S. Hoyt, D. D., of Auburn Theological Seminary, and Rev. C. F. Kittredge, of Whitesboro, who resigned the pastorate of Forest church this spring, gave the charge to the people. Rev. Mr. Robinson has been acting pastor of the church here since last May, following the acceptance of the call to Whitesboro of Mr. Kittredge.
