**Exchanged Pulpits.**

Rev. Edward W. Robinson, pastor of Forest church, will exchange pulpits with Rev. Theodore Jessup next Sunday. As that Sunday is National Tuberculosis Sunday, when it is customary for ministers to preach on the evil of the disease, Mr. Robinson announced that the addresses on tuberculosis were to be given last Sunday so that the people might have the advantages of these addresses.
