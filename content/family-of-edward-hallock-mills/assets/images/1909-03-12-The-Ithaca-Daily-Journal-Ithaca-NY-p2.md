    - "Frances Willard (September 28, 1839–February 17, 1898) was one of the best-known and most influential women of her day and headed the Women's Christian Temperance Union from 1879 to 1898. She was also the first dean of women at Northwestern University. Her image appeared on a 1940 postage stamp and she was the first woman represented in Statuary Hall at the U.S. Capitol Building." [Thoughtco.com](https://www.thoughtco.com/frances-willard-biography-3530550). "Willard turned away from a solid career in education to devote herself to the temperance crusade.  For many years she worked for the Temperance Union with no pay, living on money made at speaking engagements.  She was instrumental in the formation of the Prohibition Party, and was later elected president of the National Council of Women, largely for her belief in women's right to vote."
