  - "Grand Army hall" my be a reference to Personius Hall at present day 559 Brooktondale Road. From Molly Adams' research notes in the Caroline History Room, Slaterville Springs NY: "Walker Personius was a Civil War veteran and the village postmaster in 1882. He seems to have been the owner of Mott's original store which he called Personius Hall. The building had a large meeting space on the second floor, with seats that folded down from the wall. Memorial Day (then called Decoration Day) processions always formed in front of that building (see photo) and perhaps the David Ireland Post of Civil War Veterans met in that building. It seems clear that the post office was still at 559 Brooktondale Road in 1882." I don't know what photo was being referenced in the preceding passage. From "Tour 3 - P8" in A Drive-by Tour of the Town of Caroline: "1st Post Office & store, left -- 559 Brooktondale Road. We think this building was build by Mr. Mott, who owned most of the land at that time. ...The G.A.R. lined up here to march to the [Quick, presently Brookton] cemetery to put flowers on the graves. There was a tannery between this house and the next before 1853 owned by Silsbury & Lounsbery." Walker Personius and Edward Lounsbery were also charter members of the Congregational Church of Mott's Corners, presently called Caroline Valley Community Church, and were instrumental in its formation. George Richardson, who appears to have worked for Edward Mills at a time when Edward was Postmaster, eventually started his own grocery business in "the old Personius store" starting May 1897.

BROOKTON.

Ezra Puderbaugh, of Freeville, has returned and is again employed at Lull's blanket mill.

George Richardson is again at the postoffice, having been absent a few days on account of sickness. 

Miss Dora Morgan, who for some time past has been suffering with a throat difficulty, is convalescent.

Mrs. VanKeuren and her daughter Florence, left this morning for an extended visit among friends in Ulster and Orange counties.

The Young Ladies' Aid Society of the Congregational church will give a strawberry and ice cream festival at the rink on Monday evening next. Everybody is invited.

The "Trip around the World" at the rink last Saturday evening was taken by a fair audience. The scenes were not as distinctly shown as they might have been had the hall been higher. The entertainment, however, was no fraud; the scenes being far superior to an ordinary magic lantern show. The manager promises to visit us again soon with new scenes now in preparation.

The members of the G. A. R. of this place will observe Memorial Day after the following program: Meet at the Grand Army hall at ten A. M., march from there to Cooper's and Quick's cemeteries, and thence after decorating the graves, to the basement of the Congregational church for refreshments. Addresses will be delivered at the church by Assemblyman Smith and Frank M. Leary, of Ithaca.
