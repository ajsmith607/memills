Bridge Work Continues 

The new Brooktondale bridge across Six Mile Creek takes shape while waters flow beneath its foundation. State highway officials revealed this week that the home of Mrs. Jessie Brewer is to be raised as reconstruction of the road progresses. Many old trees and the side yard of Mrs. Brewerâ€™s home have already fallen victim to road-building. In the foreground is the railing of a side porch on the three-story house in which Mrs. Brewer was born almost 85 years ago and in which she has always lived. Her plans for the future are undecided.
