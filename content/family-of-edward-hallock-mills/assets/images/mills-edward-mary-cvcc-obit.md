    - Variations of Edward's middle name exist, such as "Hallioch" and "Halloch", however these seem to be errors, as Edward's middle name appears to be taken from his mother's maiden name: "Hallock."
    
    - "Rev. Woodworth" refers to [Reverend Allen Beach Woodworth](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/66215938/allen-beach-woodworth) (04 Jun 1837 to 11 Sep 1910), whose obituary in the Ithaca Daily News (12 Sep 1910, p3) states was the long-time pastor of the Brookton Baptist Church. This was a transition period between pastors for the Congregational Church, and in both the Ithaca Daily News and the historical records of Caroline Valley Federated Church, Reverend Woodworth is noted as performing Sunday services at the Congregational Church as well as officiating funerals for Congregation members during this time, presumably helping out in his retirement. Church records are vague on the point, but it's quite likely he helped out irregularly over many months as the Congregational Church needed his services. In the Mills' store sales journals, Emily notes paying Reverend Woodworth $3.00 for attending Edward's funeral.

1908 Deaths Continued

Edward Hallioch Mills Died Jan 1st 1908 at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. He was born at Smithtown L.I. March 25, 1819 - lacking less than 3 mos. of 89 yrs.

In Mar. 1879 He came to Brookton from Corfu N.Y. with his family and has lived among us nearly 29 years.

He united with this Ch. Dec. 13, 1896. A few remarks were made by Rev. Woodworth, Jan 3. The trend of thought was that a good man had gone - to which every heart present I feel sure responded. His interest in this Ch was unwavering and his loss seems irreparable. His body was taken to Corfu where his first wife and two sons are buried.

In this connection it seems proper to mention the death of Mrs. Mary A. Mills, although she died Dec. 28, 1895, yet I find no mention of it in these records. She was born at Hempstead L. I. Feb 8, 1819. Mrs. Mills was a member of the First Presbyterian Church of Corfu N.Y. She united with this Ch by letter June 13, 1880. Her life was a blessing to all who knew her. She was a noble, consecrated Christian.
