GOOD TEMPLAR MATTERS. 

[Compiled for the Journal.]

—County Lodge will be held Thursday and Friday, August 7th and 8th with Ithaca Union Lodge, No. 295. Don’t forget to elect your delegates and then see that they attend.

—Elect your best members for delegates to the County Lodge. 

—Remember that the County Lodge will attend the Spencer camp meeting in a body, and in full regalia Friday, August 8th. If you can’t come to Ithaca Thursday, go to Spencer Friday and be sure and take your regalia. Faithful Lodge of North Lansing expects to send a large delegation; and if this lodge, the farthest from Spencer of any lodge in the county does so well, surely the other lodges will do well also, and there will be a grand rally around our colors. Among those to be present at Spencer and deliver addresses are A. S. Draper, G.W.C.T.; the Rev. Henry Ward, P.G.W.C.T., Mrs. M. B. O’Donnell, and: John N. Stearns, Esq. Meetings will be held under the auspices of the Order in the morning, afternoon and evening. 

—It is almost time for another quarterly election. All W.C.T.'s W.V.T.’s, W.S' and W.T.’s must be full degree members. The other officers need not have taken either degree. 

—It is not proper to install by proxy. If an officer elect is absent at time of installation, elect another and go ahead. 

—Lodges will bear it in mind to recommend a suitable member for L.D. at the time of the next election of officers. A suitable one will be the best one you have got. Send in the recommendation promptly. 

—Ithaca Union Lodge is making preparation to care for a host at the county lodge. Be sure to come so that they will not be disappointed. 

—One initiation at Ithaca Union last week.  

—High Bridge Lodge, No. 296, of Motts Corners has elected the following delegates and alternates to represent them at the County Lodge session. Regulars: E. Lounsbery, Wm. Montgomery and M. D. Shaw. Alternates: Mrs. Dr. Besemer, Mrs. J. P. Merrill and Wm. Hungerford. 

—Lodges will please be prompt in sending in delegates’ credentials before the opening of the first day's session of the County Lodge, or at least let the delegates see that their credentials are in during the first half hour of the meeting; also send duplicates to the county secretary. The duplicates are the postal cards received by the W.S.'s. Also let the delegates be *particularly sure* to bring a copy of the lodge deputy’s report. If anything should possibly happen so that a lodge cannot be represented, send a copy of the deputy's report to the county secretary. 

—All who attend County Lodge, delegates or visitors are urgently requested to furnish their own regalias. 

—Don't go hunting around town for the place you want on County Lodge day. The right place is Temperance Hall, opposite Journal block, over Stevens’ marble works. 

—Remember that County Lodge begins at 10 o'clock, A.M., and not at 11 or even half past ten. Let every delegate be on hand promptly at the hour if a possible thing. I believe now I have said my say about County Lodge. At least I don’t think of any other *orders* I want to give just at present. But I did want to say just what I have said to every member in the order. If any one wants to have any fuller particulars let him apply to the County Secretary and he will answer more minutely. I don’t want to hear any one say that they didn't understand fully about the County Lodge, as I have heard them say before now. 

—We hear as follows from High Bridge Lodge, No. 296, Of Motts’ Corners: "We had a full attendance, owing partly to election of officers and also to a growing interest in our meetings. We had one initiation, also one last week.” The names of the delegates and alternates from the various lodges will be given next week. 

County Secretary.
