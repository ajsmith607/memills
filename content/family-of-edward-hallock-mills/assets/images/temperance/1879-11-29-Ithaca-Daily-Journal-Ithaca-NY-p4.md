TOMPKINS COUNTY LODGE No. 46, I.O. of G.T.

The twenty-sixth quarterly session of Tompinks [sic] County Lodge, No. 46, I.O. of G. T. was held Tuesday and Wednesday, Nov. 25 and 26 with Speedsville Lodge No. 353, of Speedsville. The situation of the place of meeting being so far removed from the centre of the county not so many of the lodges were represented as usual. But this fact did not prevent the session from being one of the most interesting and important that has been held for a long time. This was in part because the people of Speedsville have lately been much stirred up in regard to Good Templarism and they gave those who came a most hearty welcome. The great cause of the interest and importance of the meeting, however, was owing to the fact that the delegates from the different lodges were all fully in earnest in regard to the great question for the discussion of which they had met. The attendance was good through the two days. The morning session was opened short after 11 o’clock by C.J.T. R. G. H. Speed. From that time, until the close of the session, Wednesday afternoon, the interest continued unabated. There were eight lodges and one temple represented by delegates during either the whole or a part of the meeting. Some of the lodges report a slight falling off in membership since last quarter, while others again reported a large gain. Progress reported a loss of 7; Crystal Fountain of 5; Diligent reported a gain of 1: High Bridge of 7; Ithaca Union of 8; Speedsville of 25; while Ivy, though reported a numerical gain of only 1, as shown by the books stated that really their gain was much greater. This much from the lodges reported makes a very good showing indeed; what the other lodges, throughout the county will do in adding to or detracting from this report remains
yet to be seen. 

The greater part of the afternoon session was taken up with discussing the question laid down upon the programme. “How can we the most effectually accomplish the building up of our order in this county?” There was much to be said, many plans to be proposed, and much deliberation necessary in order to determine exactly what was the best method of proceeding. Among other things it was at length determined to secure the assistance of a suitable lecturer, the executive committee being authorized to use the funds now in the treasury for that purpose. This was only one of several things that was determined upon. Of the others we will speak farther on. 

Through a slight misunderstanding in the matter of arrangements, there come near being no speaker for the evening session. However a way out of the difficulty was opened by the prompt manner in which the Rev. Geo. Brown, of Mott's Corners, responded to the call for his services. He most admirably filled the threatened gap with one of his excellent lectures that always hit the mark at which they are aimed. Moreover, bros. Benjamin and Franklin were present unexpectedly to themselves and every one else, and had no small part in making the public meeting the success it was. During the second day the following resolutions were passed: 

Resolved, that the County Secretary invite all the temperance organizations of this county to meet (by means of representatives whom they shall appoint) with the executive committee of this body, for the purpose of effecting a county organization that shall have for its subject the securing of a concerted action in the work of redeeming all the towns of this county from the evils of the license system. 

Resolved: That this County Lodge appoint a committee of one from each town in this county, such persons to be chairman of a committee to be chosen from the different lodges in each town; the united committee thus appointed to be county committee for the purpose of enforcing the excise law in each town, their sole and only duty being to suppress all illegal traffic in the liquor business. 

On motion brother Epenetus Howe was made chairman of the town of Caroline, and the appointigg [sic] of the others left with C.C.T. R. G. H. Speed. 

Resolutions of thanks to Bro’s. Brown, Benjamin, and Franklin for their services at the open session were adopted, and also a vote of thanks tendered Speedsville Lodge for the royal entertainment afforded all those who were present. 

During the session it was agreed that the home talent we possessed in this county should be more effectively employed than hitherto in preparing the way for a lecturer and in assisting one after he came here. 

Therefore, Epenetus Howe, of Speedsville, agreed to go with a good body of assistants to Slaterville, Tuesday evening, December 2, to speak on the temperance question; and to Ithaca at a date to be hereafter decided upon. The above is but the merest skeleton of a report of the session. We have endeavored to condense the matter all that we could, and yet, after having left out so much that was of importance, we have trespassed upon the space and patience of the newspapers that have so kindly lent us their columns. 

However good, however important, other meetings of the county lodge may have been, this last one certainly takes the front rank. If during the next two months, a work hitherto unparalleled 1n the history of the temperance cause in this county is not done, these signs must go for naught. Brothers and sisters, let us start the movement now, this present week in our own lodges. The interest of the session was greatly added to by the presence of members from Tioga county; also by the fine singing of Brothers McWhorter and Landon of High Bridge lodge. 

The place of holding the next session yet to be determined upon. Those lodges desiring to have the next session held with them will notify the programme committee or County Secretary, as soon as possible.

County Secretary.
