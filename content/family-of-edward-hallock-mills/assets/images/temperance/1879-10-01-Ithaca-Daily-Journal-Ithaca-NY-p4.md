GOOD TEMPLAR MATTERS

–We find in one of the Auburn papers the following account of Bro. Gunnison’s work in Cayuga county up to last week:

Good Templarism once more “booms” in this county. Since W. W. Gunnison began his labors in the county, nearly 100 members have been added to the order. Wednesday evening Mr. Gunnison reorganized the lodge at Levanna, to which several new members were added; and last evening at Union Springs, Mr. Gunison instituted a new lodge to be know as “Wide Awake” lodge with forty-four applications for a charter, of whom forty-two were initiated last evening–twenty-four sisters and eighteen brothers.

–There was one initiation at Ithaca Union last week. At this meeting it was decided to hold an open session one week from this present Wednesday night and to continue to hold them monthly during the winter, the second Wednesday evening of each month being set apart for that purpose. Let the members throughout the county come and see us on any of these night and we will try to entertain them. We will try to do that any time they may come, but will be well prepared for them on these special occasions.

–The following is from High Bridge lodge: Judging from the good templar items in our county papers, one would naturally infer that there were but two or three lodges in the county.

We are sorry to see this. Our county papers have generously given good templarism a place in their columns, and we in this way get much valuable information and encouragement. But, at the same time, we do not get what we might and would get, if all the lodges in the county would report promptly and oftener. Too much praise cannot be given to the county press for what it is doing; and let us improve the opportunity by doing our part.

Our meeting two weeks ago was nearly or quite up to my idea of a lodge meeting. We had two initiations, the initiatory ceremony being performed with dignity and impressiveness. After the regular order of business, we opened under the head of the good of the order and invited a few outsiders to seats in our lodge. We had a number of recitations, songs, and instrumental pieces; also selections which were much enjoyed. One of the outsiders said it was one of the finest gatherings it had ever been his good fortune to attend and it was a wonder in his mind that the entire community were not members of our lodge. So you see I am not alone in my selfish praise of High Bridge. Like all earthly mortals, I am inclined to be selfish and perhaps put too high an estimate on our lodge. No doubt there are many lodges in this county far superior to ours; but if so they selfishly withhold from us their superior mode of conducting a lodge meeting. 

–The following is the report of the meeting of Temperance Star lodge of two weeks ago:

Temperance Star Lodge No. 384 met in their room as usual last Saturday evening and after being called to order by W.C.T., G.S. Higgins at the usual hour, they enjoyed a very pleasant session. After going through with the regular order of business they held an open session and after listening to some very choice selections spoken by Sister Lottie Preston and Sister Susie Evans they had a charade which was played by Bro. H. D. Haskins and other prominent members of our order. The charade proved very interesting and was highly appreciated by all. There was more than a usual attendance present, and also quite a large delegation from High Bridge Lodge, and taking all things into consideration I think I can say that it was one of the most profitable and interesting meetings we have had yet this quarter, and one that we could go home from and feel in our own hearts a more full determination than ever to exemplify by our lives outside of the lodge room what we learn there of Faith, Hope and Charity.

County Secretary.
