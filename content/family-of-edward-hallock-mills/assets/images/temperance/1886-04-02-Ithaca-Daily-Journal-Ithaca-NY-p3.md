ORIGIN OF THE I.O.G.T.

Fayetteville discovered to be the Birthplace of the Order.

The Fayetteville Recorder has made the discovery that Fayetteville was the birthplace of the Independent Order of Good Templars. It seems says the Recorder, "that in 1851 eleven lodges of "Good Templars" (so-called) existed in Oneida county, and another, known as "Excelsior Lodge No. 14," was started in Syracuse, meeting in a hall on the fourth floor of the Empire House. At a convention of this order held in Utica in July, 1852, Levrett E. Coon and T. S. Truair, delegates from "Excelsior Lodge," considered themselves aggrieved by the action of the convention, and withdrew therefrom, and their course was approved by the Syracuse lodge. At this time William J. Stoddard of Excelsior Lodge had corresponded with some young men of this village and on July 17, 1852, in Academy Hall, he met and obligated James H. Eaton, Edward P. Clark, Jewett J. Dunbar, Augustus Tremaine and W. H. Goodrich. On July 20, Tuesday evening, Levrett Coon came to this village and gave the obligation to six other young men, and organized them into a lodge of the "Independent Order of Good Templars," he having withdrawn from the Oneida county organization.

The new lodge, while using to some extent the ritual of the Oneida county organization, made several important changes therein and in the secret work, to separate and distinguish if from the "Good Templar." The following persons were elected officers of the new organization: W.C.T., James H. Eaton; W.V.T., Ansell Prescott; recording secretary, Jewett J. Dunbar; treasurer, Augustus Tremaine; financial secretary, Wm. H. Goodrich; M., Edward P. Clark; D.M., Calvin P. Clark; chaplain, Daniel Rider; O.G., C. J. McMyman; I. G., Wm. Johnson; P.W.C.T., Orrin D. Torrey.

These officers were at once installed. Therefore James H. Eaton was the first chief templar of the I.O.G.T. The charter of this lodge, which was called "Eureka Lodge, No. 2," is now in the office of D. W. Hooker, secretary of the Grand Lodge of New York state in the White Memorial building in Syracuse. On his return to Syracuse Mr. Coon succeeded in getting the Excelsior Lodge to withdraw from the "Good Templars" and become "Excelsior Lodge, No. 1, I.O.G.T.," although the number really belonged to the Fayetteville Lodge.

The new order spread rapidly, but owing to constitutional defects the Oneida county organization had life for only about two years. "Eureka Lodge" was represented in the Grand Lodge for three or four years, and then appears to have died a natural death, although the order of which it was the parent organization still continues to flourish.

The order which in 1852 was founded by 11 young men now contains about 725,000 members.
