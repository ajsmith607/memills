MOTT's Corners.

The amusement loving public will have another opportunity of witnessing the play of Colleen Bawn, on Wednesday and Thursday evenings, Feb. 4th and 5th. The Caroline Amateur Dramatic Club has met with public favor. It certainly deserves it. Its members have been studying assiduously, and must have improved greatly. We shall expect to see some of the parts played with a good deal of feeling and power. Some of the situations afford an abundant opportunity for the display of emotional talents. 

—We have the gratifying assurance that an immediate effort, will be made to secure a pastor at the Congregational Church. 

—The report that Capt. Personius would pass the summer in Europe is incorrect. 

—Geo. Depuy who has held the highly responsible position of telegraph operator (U., L & E. R. R) is soon to be promoted, and will leave us for a more profitable position. 

—One or two new residences will soon be ready for occupancy.

—Mr. “Al” Merritt has sold his horse (Mountain Boy) so much admired, for $800. He will be sent to California for a much larger sum.  

—There will a complimentary meeting of Rev. Mr. Brown's friends this week. His faithful service to the public 1s entitled to the highest reward. Those who find it inconvenient to attend should remember that he can be reached in other generous ways. G.
