SEVENTH ANNUAL SESSION OF TOMPKINS COUNTY LODGE, No. 46, I.O. OF G.T.

The Good Templars of Tompkins county held their seventh annual meeting at Groton on Thursday and Friday of last week. The weather being cool and pleasant a large number of members were present. 

Most of the morning session on Thursday was spent in organizing and getting ready for work; we had time, however, for some stirring speeches by Rev. E. R. Wade, of Malloryville and Epenetus Howe of Speedsville. 

On assembling in the afternoon reports were received from the different lodges in the county. With one or two exceptions these reports were very encouraging indeed. Nearly three hundred members have been added to the order during the last three months. Spring Valley Lodge of Groton leads the list in point of increase in membership, having initiated sixty-six during the quarter; Crystal Wave Lodge of Trumansburg comes next with forty-three initiations; Fidelity Lodge of McLean reported thirty-two new members and Ithaca Union Lodge thirty.  

After the reports had been given the following officers were elected for the next year: C. C. T., I. P. Smith, Ithaca; C.V.T., Mrs. W. H. Allen, Groton; C. Sec., F. P. Rundell, Ithaca; C.C., Rev. E. R. Wade, Malloryville: C.F.S., James MeLachlan, Jr., Groton; C.T., Frank Tarbell, North Lansing; C.M., Rich Morgan, Peruville; C.G., Miss Anna Thomas, Ithaca; C. Sent., Lauren Stone, McLean; C.D., Epenetus Howe, Speedsville; C.R.H.S., Miss Elosia Landon, Slaterville. C.L H.S., Miss Hattie George, Freeville. C.A. Sec, Miss Emma A. Watson, McLean: C.D.M., Miss Lill Rhodes. Representative to Grand Lodge, Edward Lounsberry[sic], Mott's Corners. 

After the election of officers a very interesting paper was read by Rev. E. R. Wade on the subject, “Our Duty, and How to Meet It.” 

An open session was held in the Congregational Church in the evening. An address of welcome was given by Rev. A. T. Edwards, of Groton, which was responded to by R. G. H. Speed, C.C.T. The paper read by Wade in the afternoon was so interesting that he was persuaded to read it again in the evening. Speeches were made by Epenetus Howe and Geo. V. Benjamin. Mr. Benjamin having just returned from Maine gave some interesting facts concerning that state. He said Good Templarism is flourishing there, the state containing about twenty thousand members of the order. The lodge at Portland contains three hundred members among which are Hon. Neal Dow; an ex-governor of the state; an ex-mayor of the city; and the prominent business and professional men of the town. Good Templars exert a great influence in shaping the policy of the state. The Maine law is a grand success, the liquor traffic being almost entirely stamped out. 

The exercise of the evening were much enlivened by the excellent music furnished by Mr. Landon from Mott's Corners and by the Groton Glee Club.  

Quite a portion of the Friday morning session was taken up with the installation of officers and the transaction of other business. Speeches were made by Mr. Stark and Mr. Corby two visitors from Cortland. 

The following resolutions were adopted : 

Resolved, That our thanks are due the Congregational Church for kindly opening their house for the public meeting of the County Lodge. 

Resolved, That Rev. A. Edwards has our hearty thanks for the cordial and eloquent welcome extended us by himself and the people of Groton. 

Resolved, That the County Lodge extend their thanks to the people of Groton for their cordial greeting and generous hospitality manifested in welcoming us to their homes. 

Resolved, That our thanks are due and are hereby tendered to the Quartette Club, of Groton for their appropriate and timely music furnished at our meetings.

Resolved, That the proceedings of this meeting of the County Lodge be published in the Groton Journal, the Ithaca Journal, the Ithaca Democrat, the Weekly Ithacan, the Trumansburg Sentinel and Dryden Herald. 

The afternoon session was spent very pleasantly in listening to speeches and music for the good of the order. The Lodge adjourned at four o’clock and after a general hand-shaking the members separated it being agreed by all that this session of County Lodge was one of the most interesting ever held in the county.

The next meeting of Tompkins County Lodge will be held at Trumansburg. 

County Secretary.
