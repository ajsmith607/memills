    - It is interesting to note that the Brookton chapter of the W.C.T.U. was organized in 1907, the same year that Jessie Shurter and Emily Mills were baptized and officially joined the membership roll of Brookton Congregational Church. Emily is listed as Superintendent of Literature and Publications. Many of her neighbors are listed beside her: Jessie Shurter (later Jessie Brewer) Mrs. Dr. B. F. Lockwood, Mrs. Daniel Mason and Anna Mulks.

    - It seems that Anna Mulks is listed as both Mrs. Charles Mulks and Mrs. Anna Mulks? 

    - Sixty five members strikes me as quite a large number of Christian women supporting temperance for such a small area, especially considering there were a number of other chapters very close by, in Danby for example.
