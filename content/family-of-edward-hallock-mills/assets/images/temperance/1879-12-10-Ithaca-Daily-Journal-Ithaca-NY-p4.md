GOOD TEMPLAR MATTERS. 

—The present quarter is about half gone; how much temperance work have you done during the past six weeks or how much has your lodge done? A thoughtful answer to the above question may do us all 
good. Let us go to work in downright earnestness again and see how much we can accomplish in six weeks. We ought to be ashamed to confess that we did not last quarter, as a county, do as well as we did in the summer months when every body was busy. 

—Speedville lodge has not stopped with the good work they commenced last quarter. They at that time doubled their membership and by the start which they had obtained two weeks ago seemed in a fair way to repeat the doubling again this quarter. They had then initiated eleven new members and had as many more applicants for admission. Of course we will not find fault with any of the work that the people of Speedville are doing. We only wish them “God Speed” in their hearty endeavors after success. We would say however to the other lodges of the county, “Go thou and do likewise.” 

The following communication is from Temperance Star Lodge, No. 384 of Caroline Centre: Although it hag been some time since our lodge has been represented in the Good Templars’ column, nevertheless our zeal for the cause is growing stronger and we feel as though we were accomplishing a good work. We have had nine initiations so far this quarter. But we do not wish to be understood that we boast of the increase of our numbers only but of the interest. But we wish it to be understood that we take pride not only in this increase of membership but also in the increase of interest manifested by all our members, old and new alike. In our last meetings we have had some excellent work done under the “Good of the Order;” fine speaking, the reading of choice selections and good music together with a large attendance has made the sessions exceedingly interesting. Last week we had a play entitled the “Rough Diamond,” which gave all who listened to its rendition great pleasure. 

—The regular monthly session of Ithaca Union Lodge occurs this week at their rooms in “Temperance Hall.” On Tuesday evening, Dec 23, they will hold a public meeting in some one of the places of public gathering in this town, the place has not yet been decided upon. At this meeting 1t is expected that not only those from Speedsville who promised to come will be present, but also many from other adjoining places will also see fit to come. We promise to make it interesting for all the brethren who will attend and of course for the sisters. Another matter in regard to Ithaca Union Lodge may be well to mention here, It is very likely that after this week the night of meeting will be Tuesday instead of Wednesday as at present. 

However due notice will be given of this fact as soon as it becomes a by-law.

Slaterville sends greeting as follows:

Crystal Fountain Lodge is doing nicely. Last Saturday night the Juvenile Temple held a meeting in the place of our lodge meeting and admitted the good templars. It being a very stormy evening but few good templars were present, but the juveniles were out in full force and did splendidly. John R. Clark is to speak Friday evening on “Intemperance” and Saturday evening on “To and Fro in London”. An interesting time is expected. 

—At a meeting of High Bridge lodge No. 296 the following resolution was unanimously adopted by the lodge 

Whereas It has pleased God to lay his hand in heavy affliction upon our brother Wesley Dorn in the death of his beloved wife, our sister, in the morning of life just at the period to our finite wisdom she seemed most needed. Therefore be it 

Resolved, that in the death of sister Dorn this lodge also 1s deeply bereaved in losing one of its faithful members and workers. 

Resolved, That while we deeply feel our loss as a lodge and as individuals our most heartfelt sympathies are extended to Bro. Dorn. 

Resolved, That with him we rejoice in the hope that our loss is her eternal gain, 

Resolved, That on one page of the book of minutes be inscribed these words: To the memory of Sarah Dorn, wife of Wesley Dorn, initiated into High Bridge Lodge, May 11, 1877; died Nov. 24, 1879. 

Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be copied on the minutes of this meeting, a copy be presented to Bro. Dorn and a copy be sent to the County Secretary for publication.
