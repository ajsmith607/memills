—The Caroline Amateur Dramatic Club played “The Colleen Bawn” on Thursday evening at Mott’s Corners, and although the night was dark and the road in a terrible condition, the hall was filled to its utmost capacity. The performance is said to have richly deserved the enthusiastic praise so generously given by the large audience.
