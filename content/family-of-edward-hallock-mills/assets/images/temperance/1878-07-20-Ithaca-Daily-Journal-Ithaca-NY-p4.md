GOOD TEMPLARS' MASS MEETING.

The Good Templars of this county will celebrate the twenty-sixth anniversary of the organization of the order by a grand mass meeting and basket picnic on the camp ground at Freeville on Thursday, August 8th, 1878. A. S. Draper, G.W.C.T., of Albany; B. K. Douglas, G.D.D., of Oneonta; Rev. Mr. Smith, of Groton; Rev. M. S. Hard, of Ithaca; Bro. E. Jones, P.C.C.T., of Trumbull's Corners; C. O. Abbott, G.D.D., of Auburn are expected to be present and address the meeting. Rev. Dwight Williams, of Trumansburg, will deliver an original poem. 

Good music will be present and a grand good time is expected. All are invited and are requested to put an extra ten cent piece in their pocket to help pay the expenses of the meeting.
