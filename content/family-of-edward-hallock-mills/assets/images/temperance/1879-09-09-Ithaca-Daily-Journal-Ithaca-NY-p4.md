GOOD TEMPLAR MATTERS.

–One initiation last Wednesday night at Ithaca Union.

–The Sons of Temperance in North America number about 90,000; the Temple of Honor, 20,000; while our Order, which extends to every civilized and semi-civilized quarter of the globe, numbers about 300,000.

–Good Templarism in Cayuga County is about as low as it can be. There were at one time Thirty-three lodges in that county, but they have fallen off till only three remain. But the prospect is that the work is about to revive in that district. W. W. Gunnison, Grand Lodge lecturer, strikes that county this month, and, if he meets with his usual success, there will be some good work done in old Cayuga directly. To those acquainted with the history of the Order there and its working for the past few years, there is another illustration of the fact if Good Templars lodges are used for any other purpose than that of advancing the cause of temperance, or are turned to promote selfish ends, they will miserably fail. We are glad that the Good Templars of Tompkins county understand so well the objects for which we are banded together. Let us never forget the results we are laboring for and each time that success perches on our banners, move forward with greater zeal to crown the foe to the wall.

–Onondaga county has 22 lodges, with a membership of 1,625, and increase in three months of 165. That completely settles the “hash” for Tompkins County since our gain in membership last quarter was only forty. How much of a gain are we going to report next November?

–The following communication from Progress, No. 93, of Freeville, is gladly received. It is the first we have had from that lodge but we hope no the last:

Freeville, Sept. 2, ‘79

Progress Lodge, although numbering only forty members, is still working harmoniously and adding to its membership. At our last installation we made choice of Wm. Glazier for W.C.T., and we believe that office as well as all the others in our lodge are held by the best of the officers. At this season of the year our attendance is not fully up to the average, but now as harvest and threshing are nearly over we shall expect all to come out. I am sorry to say that we have some members who get led away by associates that think it is a good joke to lead a Good Templar to violate their solemn pledge. Such members we attend to and if we cannot keep them within bounds we give them what is called the “grand bounce.” We don’t want such, but we will try in every way, and a number of times, if there is any hope, to keep them with us.

We have noticed communications from neighboring lodges published in the Ithacan and Journal but have seen none from our lodge. We don’t see why, as we have members that are competent and have been urged to assist you in the good work. Perhaps we may induce our Secretary to lend a helping hand.

–The correspondent from High Bridge Lodge sends in a long communication which we will be glad to publish next week. It is crowded out this week by other matter which came in ahead. We glean a few facts from it. He says: Our lodge was never in better condition than at the present time. During the present quarter we have had four initiations and expect to report many more before its close. Dr. Besemer, assisted by other members of the band gave us some excellent music. Miss Mills, Miss Keeler, Mr. Ludwig and Mr. Miller read selections; and Bro. Lounsbery gave us an interesting account of his trip and stay at Grand Lodge.

–From Crystal Fountain in Slaterville we hear as follows:

Our last two sessions have been of unusual interest, for, although we admitted no new members, we made the most our time when we came to “Good of the Order.” At our last meeting, one of our older members, Bro. Slater, gave us a brief history of the temperance work in this vicinity from his earliest recollection, Sister Dora Wilson, of Ithaca Union Lodge, favored us with music, the remainder of the time being occupied in interesting remarks and selections. Bro. Lewis Schuster, of Ithaca Union, and Bro. Luding, of High Bridge Lodge, made very interesting remarks. Bro. Schuster also recited a poem. We also had a selection read and had any number of short speeches, making it a very interesting session.
