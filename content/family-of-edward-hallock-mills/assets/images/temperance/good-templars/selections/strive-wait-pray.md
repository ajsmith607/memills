STRIVE, WAIT, AND PRAY. 

Strive; yet I do not promise 
The prize you dream of to-day 
Will not fade when you think to grasp it, 
And melt in your hand away; 
But another and holier treasure, 
You would now perchance disdain,
I Will come when your toil is over, 
And pay you for all your pain, 

Wait; yet I do not tell you 
The hour you long for now 
Will not come with its radiance vanished, 
And a shadow upon its brow; 
Yet far through the misty future, 
With a crown of starry light, 
An hour of joy you know not 
Is winging her silent flight. 

Pray; though the gift you ask for 
May never comfort your fears, 
May never repay your pleading, 
Yet pray, and with hopeful tears; 
An answer, not that you long for, 
But diviner, will come one day; 
Your eyes are too dim to see it, 
Yet strive, and wait, and pray.
