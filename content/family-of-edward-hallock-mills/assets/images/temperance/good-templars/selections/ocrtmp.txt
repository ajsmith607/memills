STRIVE, WAIT, AND CRAY. $9 





STRIVE, WAIT, AND PRAY. 

Strive ; yet I do not promise The prize you dream of to-day Will not fade when you think to grasp it, And melt in your hand away ; But another and holier treasure, You would now perchance disda* 1 Will come when your toil is over, And pay you for all your pain, 

Wait ; yet I do not tell you The hour you long fer now Will not come with its radiance vanished, And a shadow upon its brow ; Yet far through the misty future, With a crown of starry light, An hour of joy you know not Is winging her silent Hight. 

Pray ; though the gift you ask for May never comfort your fears, May never repay your pleading, Yet pray, and with hopeful tears: An answer, not that you long for, But diviner, will come one day ; Your eyes are too dim to sec it, Yet strive, and wait, and pray.
