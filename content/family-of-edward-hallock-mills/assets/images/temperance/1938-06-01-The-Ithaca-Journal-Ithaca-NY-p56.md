Inlet Section Busy Half Century Ago 

Just before 1888 was the golden day of Ithaca’s manufacturing. A cluster of mills at the foot of Fall creek’s Ithaca Falls was turning out paper, guns, agricultural implements, plaster, pottery and flour. Down in the Inlet section, in the city’s First Ward, things were even busier. An old First Ward resident recalled the days. 

“The Ithaca Organ Company was the biggest thing in the Inlet section at that time,” he said. “It started in a little wooden building on the south side of the creek and later came across and put up a brick building on the east side. They made organs on the west side and pianos on the east. They employed about 300 men at one time. About 1885, though, the business went to pieces through mismanagement. When it was going, Ithaca organs and pianos were well known and pedalled throughout the country. Every farmhouse had an Ithaca organ for miles around here. At one time the company got Wegman, the German piano man, to come here and look after the business but he went to Auburn and set up business for himself. You've heard of Wegman pianos.
