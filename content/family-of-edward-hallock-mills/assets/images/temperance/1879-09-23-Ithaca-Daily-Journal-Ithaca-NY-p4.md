GOOD TEMPLAR MATTERS

Compiled for the Journal.

–There are in New York State 446 lodges of Good Templars. Of this number 109 were initiated last year and of those 109 thirty were instituted by Bro. Gunnison. Our membership, last May was 22,222. Of this number, 11,509 were initiated last year. 

–At the last session of the Grand Lodge there were represented English, German and Swedish lodges, together with negro and India, and yet some say that Good Templarism doesn’t reach all classes.

–The Grand Lodge of Missouri is the leading grand lodge as far as the number of new lodges for the past year counts, having instituted 160 since their last grand lodge. Eighty-seven counties of the state have lodges in working order.

–The clause in the new Massachusetts liquor law requiring every liquor dealer to get the written consent of the owner of the premises is a source of great trouble in the trade, because many real estate owners, while willing to take the money of such tenants, refuse to commit themselves on paper. Some of the most prosperous places in Boston are closed.

–The Ward Lodge of New South Wales at its sixth annual session reported the increase in lodges during the year as 100 per cent and of membership over 200 per cent. At the sixth session of the Grand Lodge of Tasmania (Australasia) reported 2,231 members. The seventh annual session of the Grand lodge of Victoria (Australasia) reported 121 working lodges and a membership of 5,697. That grand lodges has also under its jurisdiction 22 juvenile temples with 1,084 members, and that is what they are doing on the other side of the world.

–Progress lodge, No. 93, of Freeville, has at length, we are glad to hear, elected a regular correspondent, and we hope to hear from them oftener hereafter. A few weeks ago, they had an entertainment given by N. R. Streeter and family, assisted by Miss Nina Halsey, and Dana Rhodes. Next Friday evening, Sept 26, they are to give another of these popular and enjoyable musical feasts at the Lyceum Hall, Freeville. They invite all to attend, especially the members of neighboring lodges.

–Our correspondent from High Bridge Lodge, of Mott’s Corners, sends us the following account of their meeting one week ago Friday night:

Another initiation to-night. Much praise is due to the young members of our lodge in inducing their young friends to join our order and I can assure them that their efforts are much appreciated. I have taken some pains to get an expression of the older members and I find they do not look upon the younger ones as merely paying members but *live* workers and a material means of success to our lodge. May they continue the good work. Our selections and music were good and [unclear], allow me on behalf of our lodge to express thanks to the large number of visiting members from Slaterville and Caroline Centre for their presence at our last meeting, and extend a hearty invitation to come again and bring their friends. We also extend the invitation to all other members of our Order. Our latch string is always out to our friends and it shall be our endeavor to make it interesting for them.

–G.W.S. Hooker and the following in the Good Templar Gem which may be meant for some of our lodges: “All lodges whose night of meeting is wrongly reported in last year’s Journal of Proceedings, or who have changed to some other evening since then, will please report the change to the G.W.S. at once, whether before reported or not, that it may appear correct in the Journal of 1879.”

–Two initiations at Ithaca Union last Wednesday evening. Ithaca Union challenges any lodge, or any two lodges in the county to report more initiations at the next county lodge, for the present quarter than she does. She has invited nine so far and expects more next week. Last quarter she initiated 21 and intends to do better for these three months than that. If the lodges around the county expect to give Ithaca Union a hard thing to do in coming in ahead this quarter, they will have to wake up pretty soon. Last quarter, Crystal Fountain, of Slaterville, initiated 20. We have not heard even a whimper from that lodge this quarter. Will some one tell us whether or not Crystal Fountain has suspended? Last quarter Speedsville did a good work and reported a number of initiations. What are you doing at Speedsville now-a-days?

–Last quarter, Diligent, of Peruville, Faithful, of North Lansing, Charity, of West Dryden, Joy, of Dryden, Purity, of Etna all reported a number of initiations. But that was for last quarter; what are you doing this quarter? Come! enough of dilly dally! Rally all among the line and tell us what you are doing! If you have done nothing, then, out of shame for that nothing, if for no higher reason, go to work and accomplish something. It can not be that you are looking back with so much satisfaction on what you did last quarter that you think there is no need of effort now. Because you had your breakfast yesterday morning, it isn’t any reason why you don’t want it again this morning. The time of year has come now when you ought to begin to do hard work in fixing for an earnest and determined fall and winter campaign. Don’t put it off till long in November, but go to work now; else you will lose the best month of the year. If it wasn’t slang, we would say “brace up” for hard work, but it *is* slang and so we only say do your best for the next two months.
