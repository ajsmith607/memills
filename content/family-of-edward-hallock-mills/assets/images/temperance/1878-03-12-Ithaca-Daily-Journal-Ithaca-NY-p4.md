  - Note that this is actually the *second* anniversary of the High Bridge Lodge, and not the third as indicated, based on several sources that corroborate that the Lodge organized in Mar 1876.

MOTT'S CORNERS.

HIGH BRIDGE LODGE, NO. 296, I. O. of G. T.,

Celebrated their third anniversary by giving a public supper in their Lodge rooms, Friday evening, March 8th. It was largely attended and highly enjoyed by all. Especial credit is due Mrs. Josiah Shurtor [sic] and the young lady members of the lodge who superintended the refreshments. After supper the guests and members listed to some fine instrumental music by the Lodge Band, conducted by Dr. Besemer. High Bridge Lodge is one of the largest and most successful Lodges in Tompkins County and is noted for its suppers also for its music, both vocal and instrumental, as all who have attended will bear your correspondent witness, and here allow me to say the Lodge will give a public entertainment in the Congregational Church, Wednesday evening, March 20. The programme will consist of the well known and popular drama, Rip Van Winkle, or the Sleepy Dutchman of the Catskill Mountains, also music, tableaux, &c. The Lodge has spared no cost of pains in obtaining costumes and scenery to make this one of the first dramatic entertainments that has ever been presented to the public in this place. The scenery is all new and painted expressly for this play.
