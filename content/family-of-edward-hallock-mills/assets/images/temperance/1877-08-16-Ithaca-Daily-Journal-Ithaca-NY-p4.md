Resolutions of Respect. 

At a regular meeting of Mott's Corners’ Division of the Sons of Temperance, held on the 11th day of August, 1877, the following resolutions were ordered printed in the Ithaca Journal. 

Whereas, the Great Patriarch above has removed by death our worthy brother, Josiah Shurter, in the midst of his usefulness, although advanced in years, therefore 

Resolved, That we cherish the memory of his many virtues and good works, both in our order and among his neighbors and friends. 

Resolved, That we tender our heartfelt sympathies to the bereaved family, and large circle of relatives. 

Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be presented to the family of our deceased brother, entered upon the minutes of the Division, and published in the Ithaca Journal.
