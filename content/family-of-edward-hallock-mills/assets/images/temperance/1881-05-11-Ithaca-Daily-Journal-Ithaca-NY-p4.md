TEMPERANCE MATTERS.

The people of North Lansing are actively at work making preparations for the session of County Lodge to be held at that place May 24th and 25th. They are determined to do all in their power to make this session a successful one. We hope the Good Templars of other localities will do their part also. This being the annual meeting a large amount of important business is to be transacted. It is hoped that every lodge in that county will be well represented. 

The county secretary visited High Bridge lodge at Mott's Corners last Friday evening. This lodge is gaining in strength and is in a flourishing condition. 

Ithaca Union Lodge has received new impetus this quarter and may be relied upon to report a large increase in membership in the near future. There were eight propositions for membership at the last meeting. Four candidates were initiated.

Cascadilla Lodge at Ithaca, is also doing good work. The report shows a net gain of eighteen members during last quarter.

County Secretary.
