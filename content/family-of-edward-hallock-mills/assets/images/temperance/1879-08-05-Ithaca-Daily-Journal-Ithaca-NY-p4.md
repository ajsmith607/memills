GOOD TEMPLAR MATTERS.

Compiled for the Journal.

–The Grand Lodge is to be held this year at the Thousand Islands, one of the finest pleasure grounds in world. [sic] The fare from Syracuse for a round trip is only two dollars and fifty cents. If enough from this county attend, the fare from Ithaca and return will not exceed four dollars. These will be the cheapest excursion rates that have ever been given to the Thousand Islands. There is no reason why a large number from this vicinity should not attend, and it is especially important that every lodge be represented at the Grand Lodge this year, for business of the greatest importance to the Order is to be transacted.

—Faithful, No. 63, of North Lansing has just elected and installed a fine corps of officers for the ensuing quarter. It will be noticed that they have filled the W.C.T.’s chair with a lady and the W.V.T.’s with a gentleman, which change is a good one to make occasionally. We give the officers below:

Mrs. L. J. Townley, W.C.T.; J. S. Osmun, W.V.T.; L. J. Townley, W.S.; Miss Minnie Brown, W.F.S.; Denton Lobdell, W.T.; Wm. H. Buckley, W.C.; Frank Singer, W.M.; Mrs. Wm. Wilcox, W.I.G.; Abram Armstrong, W.O.G. Frank Tarbell received the recommendation for Lodge Deputy for the ensuing year. Frank Tarbell, J. S. Osmun and L. J. Townley were elected delegates to the session of the County Lodge.

Diligent Lodge, No. 137, of Peruville, installed the following officers on Saturday evening last for the quarter ending Nov. 1, 1879:

W.C.T., J. P. Moe; W.V.T., Mate Fox; W. Sec., Rich Morgan; W.F.S., Charley Gross; W.T., M. J. Larned;W.C., Emma Moe; W.M., Eugene Moe; W.I.G.; Sarah Johnson; W.O.G., A. C. McLachlan; W.A.

–At the regular meeting of Crystal Fountain lodge, No. 234, of Slaterville, Saturday evening, the following officers were installed by Bro. Lounsbery of High Bridge lodge: W.C.T., C. H.

Sent., Ora Delaney; D.M., Clara Higgins; A.S., Alonzo Carle; R.H.S., Mary Harding; L.H.S., Jennie Smith.

—The list of new officers for High Bridge lodge, No. 296, was sent last week, but, on account of the press of other matter, we were unable to publish it at that time, and laid it by for this week; but evidently we put it in too secure a place since we are unable to find it when wanted. IF the secretary of that lodge will send us another list in his next communication, we will take care that is has a watchful eye kept on it.

–One initiation at Ithaca Union, No. 295, again last week.

MOTTS’ CORNERS

–S. B. Landon has returned from the West, having purchase 160 acres of land in Dickinson County, Kansas. He expects to go thither with his family some time this fall or winter. Will Heath started last week for Abilene, Kansas to put in Mr. Landon’s winter wheat, and take charge of his mules, etc. Quite and undertaking for a boy who never had been west of Elmira before.

–Rev. Geo. Brown announced last Sunday that there would be no services on Sunday evenings during the month of August. It was quite [sic] surprise and disappointment to many, especially the young folks.

–F. G. Ault has his cellar complemented and expects to soon be the owner and occupant of a new house, it is pleasantly situated and will be an ornament to our village.

–Jusus Heath has his new blacksmith shop enclosed, and the sound of the hammer and anvil will soon be heard within its walls.

–Geo. G. DePuy has the lumber and material on the spot preparatory to repairing and beautifying his house, and so the work goes on.

–A number of fresh items may be expected soon from this town, but we will not mention them yet as it might discourage the coming census taker.

FOGY.
