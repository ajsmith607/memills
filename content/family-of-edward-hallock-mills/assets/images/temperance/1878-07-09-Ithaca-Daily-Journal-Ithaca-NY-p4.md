MOTTS CORNERS. 

—July 9.—The Rev. S. Vorhis, of Spencer, has preached in the Baptist church, since Mr. Brown went away; but we understand he is not expected again. 

—The meeting of the Sons of Temperance last Saturday evening, though not quite as full as usual, was very interesting. The following is a list of the officers installed for the present quarter. W. P., Homer Genung; W. A., Alida Vorhis; R. S., Elmer Landon; A. R. S., Carrie Bates; F. S., John Loungbery: Treas., Richard Lounsbery; Chap., Ophelia Aldrich; C., Jay Jansen; A. C., Cynthia Vorhis; J. S., Howard Shurter; O. S., Charlie Lounsbery.
