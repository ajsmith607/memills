GOOD TEMPLAR MATTERS.

There are at present between 1,000 and 1,100 Good Templars in the county. If the various lodges in the county maintain the same spirit–during the present quarter that they manifested last, we can report an addition of 200 or 300 to that number at the next County Lodge. Let us rally to the work!

An attempt will be made on Monday evening, March 1, to organize a lodge among the colored people of Ithaca. From present indications the attempt will prove a successful one.

Ithaca Union Lodge has had eight initiations so far this quarter and about twenty propositions. 

Cascadilla Lodge, No. 177, of Ithaca, is getting into good working order. They have had initiations at every meeting since their institution. They meet at Temperance Headquarters on Saturday evenings.

Spring Valley Lodge of Groton has organized a reading room in connection with their lodge. They have the furnishing of their room well under way, and when the work is completed, they will have as pleasant quarters as can be found in the county. In fact, we understand that the lodge room goes ahead of anything in the shape of a Good Templar’s room, in this part of the State. We wish that the lodge would appoint a regular correspondent that we might be kept informed through the Good Templars’ column of their movements.

The various temperance organizations throughout the county will receive a communication in a few days from the secretary of the County Temperance Society. Among other things in this communication will be a request for all the lodges to appoint delegates to meet at Temperance Headquarters in Ithaca, on the first Saturday afternoon in March, at one o’clock. We hope to see a strong delegation present.

On Monday evening the members of the Ithaca Union Lodge celebrated the anniversary of their birthday by having a re-union. Members were present from Slaterville, McLean, and other parts of the county, and a very pleasant evening was spent. Various literary exercises occupied a part of the evening among which were a history of the lodge by Bro. Baldwin, an essay by Sister Jennie Burritt, a declamation by Sister Minnie Christiance, and charades by various members together with music. After these the friends repaired to the dining room, where they performed some wonderful gastronomical feats. After the supper various toasts were given out responded to by Brothers Gallagher and White of Slaterville, and Brothers Holden, Franklin, Scudder and Hyde and Sister Seaman of Ithaca, after which a prophecy was read. A more detailed account of the pleasant affair we are unable to give on account of lack of space.

As already announced through the columns of the county papers, a call for a meeting of the Grand District Convention has been made for the 18th of March at Ithaca, by the Grand District Deputy, Bro. Andrews. Of course a good representation will be present from this county. G.W.C.T. Draper will be present during the session.

County Secretary.
