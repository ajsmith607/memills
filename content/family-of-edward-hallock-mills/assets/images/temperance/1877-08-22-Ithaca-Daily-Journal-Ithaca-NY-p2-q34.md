MOTT’S CORNERS. 

Aug. 21.–A Murphy meeting was held in the Congregational Church last Sunday evening, Although the house was not full, during the evening about fifty signed the pledge and donned the blue ribbon. Dr. Parker, of Ithaca, conducted the meeting. (Short addresses ware made by Messrs. Wheelock, Sanders, Denman and others. Altogether the Murphy movement seems to be a success Here. Another meeting was appointed for next Monday evening. 

—Mr. George L. Graham spent one day last week visiting the school, and his many friends at Mott’s Corners.  

–Miss Hattie Lounsbery is visiting at Corning.

—Quite a large number from here attended the camp meeting at Spencer last Sunday, it being the first time in a number of years the gates have been open on Sunday. 

–School commenced last week with about fifty scholars.  Mr. E. C. Barto, of Jacksonville, is the principal for the next year. 

–People wishing to attend the temperance picnic next Friday at, or near,  Tobeytown, are requested to meet at the Congregational Church, at half-past eight o’clock. The procession starts at nine o’clock.

–The Congregational Sunday School has been re-organized. Dr. Besemer is superintendent. They have a supply of good teachers, and quite a large number of scholars, and will be glad to see as many more as will attend. Everything that is necessary to make it instructive and interesting will be done. I understand they intend to give a concert before long.
