INSTALLATION OF A LODGE

County Deputy Andrews assisted by Dr. B. W. Franklin, L. D., of Crandall Lodge, of Ithaca, instituted "High Bridge Lodge" of Motts Corners, last week, with fifty petitioners and forty-two initiated. The following are the officers elected and installed.

Geo. L. Graham, W.C.T.; Mrs. D. Besemer, W.V.T.; M. T. Denman, W.C.[unclear]; Dr. M. Besemer, W.S.; Miss Libbie Sanders, W.A.S.; Clarence Lull, W.F.S.; Sam Woodhull, W.T.; Arthur Denman, W.M.; Mrs. William Hungerford, W.O.M.; Mrs. Morris Losey, W.I.G.; George Richardson, W.O.G.; Mrs. E. Lounsbery, W.R.H.S.; Mrs. M. T. Denman, W.L.H.S.; Wm. Hungerford, P.W.C.T.; J. L. Mandeville, L.D.

This Lodge starts with a foundation that must insure success, being composed as it is of men and women of age, experience and standing in the community, who join this Order not from mere curiosity but for the promotion of the cause of temperance and the benefitting of their fellow mortals.

Some twenty more are to unite with them at their next meeting, thus giving them strength to commence the good work at once.

This Lodge will for the present meet on Monday evening in "Lounsberry [sic] Hall" over the store of Mr. Sanders, who by the way, with his family are members of the Order.

We guarantee a good report from them.

C. D.
