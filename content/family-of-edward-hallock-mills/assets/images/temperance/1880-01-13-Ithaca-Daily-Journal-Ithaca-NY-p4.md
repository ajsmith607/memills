GOOD TEMPLAR MATTERS.

–Gunnison has commenced his work in earnest in this county. This (Tuesday) evening and to-morrow, he will spend at West Danby. From there he goes to Danby for one evening and then strikes off into Lansing, going first to Lake Ridge on Friday evening and Saturday at Lansingville. Sunday and Monday evenings he lectures in Ludlowville and Tuesday evening at North Lansing.

–The following letter from Freeville explains itself:

Progress Lodge by unanimous vote at their last meeting extends a hearty invitation to the officers of the County Lodge to hold their next session with them at Freeville. Although the convenience for entertaining them may not be as commodious as is an older village, still our people will be pleased to have you meet with them and will do all they can to make you welcome. Trusting that our invitation will meet their approbation, I am 

Fraternally, W. H. Richmond, W.S.

No better place than Freeville could be selected for holding the County Lodge. The session will probably be held early in February as it is desired to have the County Lodge meet just as Brother Gunnison closes his work in the county.

—A communication was received from the correspondent of Crystal Fountain Lodge last week, but it came too late for insertion and would probably be stale by this week. One of the things mentioned was that Crystal Fountain Lodge had started a paper of which Miss Elosia Landon was editor. We have forgotten who was assistant editor. Saturday evening, W. W. Gunnison lectured at Enfield Centre. He found, just before commencing the lecture that there was a Division of the Sons lately re-organized there, and feeling that the place was too small to support two strong organizations, he urged all to turn in and assist the Sons. We believe that his lecture there did much to set the people to thinking more earnestly and that the result will certainly be beneficial to the Division at that place. We wish them every success in their good work. From Enfield he went to Trumansburg, and of his work there he himself will tell us at a later time.

–The County Union Temperance meeting that was held at Temperance Headquarters in this place last Saturday afternoon was adjourned to meet in two weeks at the same place. Will every lodge and temperance organization of whatever kind see to it that they have a good delegation presented at that time.

–The drama which was to have been played at Mott’s Corners this week Wednesday and Thursday evenings has been postponed one week on account of the illness of one o the actors, Mr. W. T. Graham. This drama was to be given for the benefit of High Bridge Lodge and we think many from the neighboring lodges will be present to make up a load and go.

–It is time to begin preparations for election of officers for the new quarter. Put up your best men, and then elect them. 

–Ithaca Union Lodge had four initiations last Tuesday evening, and several additional propositions.

County Secretary.
