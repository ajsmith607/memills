MOTT’S CORNERS. 

Sept. 11.—There will be an ice cream, and peach festival at the house of Mr. Kellog, on Friday evening of the present week, for the benefit of the Congregational church. All are cordially invited to attend. 

—The mite party at Mr. Personius’s was quite well attended, and passed off very pleasantly. 

–Mrs. Julia Platt of Towanda, Pa., is visiting her relatives, and numerous friends at Mott's Corners. 

— William Roe’s little girl,who has been dangerously ill for some time past, is slowly getting better. 

—Theodore Mandeville’s little girl died Sunday afternoon. The funeral was held in the Congregational church, Tuesday morning. 

–Rev. William Spaulding died at his residence on Monday, after a brief illness. His funeral occurred on Wednesday afternoon, in the Baptist Church. This makes two funerals in one week. An unusual occurrence in this place. 

–Mr. S. J. Pettigrove is so far recovered as to be about a little. I hope to see him improve rapidly.

–Another Murphy meeting was held in the Congregational Church Monday evening, and proved very interesting. Nearly forty more wear the blue ribbon.

The Hayseeds of Danby and the B. B. club of this place played a match game here last Saturday, resulting in a core of 12 to 11 in favor of the Hayseeds.

Some persons entered the cellar of the Baptist parsonage last Friday night, and helped themselves to all of Mrs. Brown’s canned fruit, cakes, pies, etc., without asking permission, or even waiting to say, thank you. 

Zoe.
