GOOD-TEMPLAR SPLINTERS.

There are fourteen Good-Templar lodges in the county distributed through the various towns as follows: Ithaca, 1; Lansing, 1; Dryden, 4; Groton, 2; Caroline, 4; Danby, 1; Newfield, 1; while Enfield and Ulysses have none.

There are also two juvenile temples in the county; one in Ithaca and one in Slaterville.

The town of Caroline is the "banner town" of the county; Lansing has the largest lodge, while every lodge, we hope is the *best* lodge.

One of the most flourishing lodges in the county is Progress, No 93, of Freeville. For two or three years they were sickly enough "up there" but about two quarters ago they went to work and began to carry out the principles of our order, and to make their lodge a home for reformed men, and in this short time they have more than doubled their numbers. They had one initiation last Saturday evening. There is one truth, at least, supported by the history of this lodge, and that is "As soon as people see that an organization is helping and saving men, they give it their support."

There have been eight members initiated into Ithaca Union Lodge this quarter and the quarter is only three weeks old. Can any lodge show a better report so far? If so, let us hear from you soon, for they will swell that number next week.

This lodge also held a very pleasant sociable in their rooms last Tuesday evening, and have a festival in view in the near future.

We have received the following communication from the Secretary of High Bridge Lodge, No. 296, of Motts Corners: "It can truly be said that High Bridge Lodge is in a very flourishing condition. The regular weekly meetings are very interesting and well attended even at this busy season. The following are our officers for the present quarter: W. C. T., John McWhorter; W. V. T., Mrs. F. G. Ault; W. S., Geo. G. Depuy; W. A. S., Miss Ellen Allen; W. M., M. D. Shaw; W. D. M., Mrs. Geo. G. Depuy; W. F. S., Geo. E. Vandemark; W. T., F. G. Ault; W. C., Arthur Denman; W. I. G., Stephen Voorhis; W. O. G., Mrs. Dr. Besemer; R. H. S., Miss Cinthia Vorhis; L. H. S., Miss Gussie Merrill.

We have an orchestra in connection with our new lodge, consisting of the following members: Geo. G. Depuy, 1st violin; Dr. M. Besemer, 2nd violin; W. T. Graham, organist; John McWhorter, bass viol; J. P. Merrill, guitar. Their choice selections of instrumental music interspersed through the business part of the meetings tend to greatly enliven us. We also boast of having as fine a band of singers as can be found in this part of the country.

The lodge has recently purchased a new organ of the Ithaca Organ Company, of which we have every reason to be proud.

Our list of members comprises many of the wealthy and influential men and women of this vicinity, such as Moses T. Denman and family, Wm. Hungerford and family, Rev. Geo. Brown, Edward Lounsbery and wife, etc., all of whom are good workers in the cause of temperance, and prove their interest in our lodge by their regular attendance and willingness to take an active part in the exercises at all times. Our membership at present is about seventy, and more are being added to the ranks almost weekly. Our lodge has already done much good in this village. We have some genuine "reformed men" with us who by their faithfulness to the lodge and its principles prove that they are in earnest.

Our lodge meets each Friday evening in Lounsbery's Hall, where we are always pleased to have visitors from other lodges call and lend us a helping hand or speak for us a few words of encouragement. Hoping to hear from some our sister lodges through these columns I remain yours fraternally,

Geo. G. Depuy, W. Sec.

The Sec. of Temperance Star, No. 384, of Caroline Centre, says that this lodge is in a more prosperous condition than ever before.

There have been three initiations since county lodge was held at Slaterville, and still others who have sent in their names. The lodge edits a paper entitled "The Temperance Herald," the regular appearance of which is looked forward to with much pleasure. The next number is to be read before the lodge Saturday evening, May 31st.
