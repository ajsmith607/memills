–The Caroline Amateur Dramatic Club repeated the drama “The Colleen Bawn” here on Wednesday and Thursday evenings of last week. They were greeted with a crowded house on both evenings and universal praise was bestowed upon all the members of the club. Where the characters were all so well sustained it would be difficult to make particular mention of any without doing injustice to others. Competent critics pronounce it to be much superior to amateur performances in general. The music was furnished by Dr. Besemer’s orchestra and was fully in keeping with the performance on the stage. The club have received pressing invitations to present the play at Candor, Danby, Slaterville and several other places.
