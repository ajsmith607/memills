GOOD TEMPLAR MATTERS. 

—The report has just reached us from Fidelity Lodge, No. 86, of McLean for last quarter, and is encouraging. They had four initiations last quarter, no suspensions, no deaths, and one withdrawal leaving a net gain of three. The lodge 1s certainly proving true to its name. Fidelity forever!  

—Onondaga county has just been divided into districts by the Good Templars for the purpose of enabling them to hold union meetings once a month. They have made five districts in the county. The step seems to us to be a good one and worthy of imitation whenever practicable. 

-- The regular weekly communication from High Bridge Lodge is given below: 

Mott’s Corners, Dec. 20. 

“Oh! brudder you’s ought to have been dar!” We mean that we had a good meeting last Friday evening at High Bridge. This is nothing unusual because we have good meetings every week. But last Friday evening was one of those times we can look back to with especial pleasure for a long while, and in the future meetings will be considered good, bad, or indifferent in proportion as they approach to the standard set up last week. And what was the cause of all this? Why the members of Temperance Star Lodge of Caroline Centre were present and ave us under the “Good of the Order” a short play entitled the “Rough Diamond.” The acting was good. Where all did so well it seems to be impossible to set forth the particular ones who excelled; yet we must needs mention Jay Clark, R. C. Clark and Brother Haskins who acted their parts especially well. Besides this we had recitations by Sister Evans and Bro. Jenks. Our own members also furnished songs and recitations and Dr. Besemer’s orchestra favored us with several selections. We like these meetings where we as members of one Lodge can assist our sister Lodges and be assisted in turn, The friends from Caroline Centre claimed to be indebted to us because we had been there at different times and helped them—at least they say we helped them—and desiring to show their indebtedness, they volunteered to come and give us this play. They may now, however, rest assured that they have paid off all old scores and more too, and we would like to get them indebted to us again. At our next meeting we discuss the question of “Home Amusements.”  

—Last Tuesday evening Ithaca Union Lodge held a public meeting at its rooms., The meeting was ad dressed by Bro's. Legg, Smith, Howe and Jenks of Speedsville. To say that they all spoke eloquently and to the point would be to say what outsiders felt who listened to them. But it would not convey any conception of the good that they did us as a lodge, We wanted just the help that we received at that time. They reached for us a class that we had labored for in vain before they came. But now we have broken the ice and we hope to receive goodly additions from that quarter, and by the added influence thus gained, to be infinitely more useful than ever before. The brethren from Speedsville may rest assured that they have laid up for themselves, among the good templars here, an unlimited stock of thanks, upon which they may draw at any time and always get the full value of their draft. We hope some time to be able to prove by our actions that our words are not idle. 

Such news as the following is very encouraging: 

Caroline Center, Dec. 29. 

Temperance Star Lodge is still “booming.” Last Saturday evening’s session wad one of the most profitable and enjoyable sessions that we ever held. 

Three candidates were initiated, namely: Mrs. F. A. Snow, Mrs. G. S. Higgins and Miss Gertrude Ward. There were also several propositions for membership. Owing to the liberality of some of our members in furnishing refreshments in the shape of nuts, fruit &c. intermission was unusually well enjoyed. 

For the “good of the order” we were favored with short speeches from several of our members. 

In our the opinion Temperance Star Lodge never was a more prosperous condition than at the present time. Thus far during this quarter we have initiated fifteen, “and still there are more to follow.” Still, we flatter ourselves that we could have held our own, had we not had a single initiation this winter. For, as our report for last quarter shows, we had 53 members in good standing; and moreover a very large majority of these were not only *regular* attendants but *active* members as well. 

Our treasury also, was in a flourishing state, there being in it a surplus of some $13 or $14 at the end of last quarter. 

In giving you these facts, we have had no other object than to assure those of our friends who suppose that the late ‘influx’ of members was all that saved our lodge from dying a natural death, that there was no cause for fear. It seems to us that a lodge having an average attendance of 35 or 40—that even dreams of giving up “the ship” is not worthy of the name of a permanent organization 

— Crystal Fountain Lodge of Slaterville has another *tidbit* for us this week as follows:  

Miss Elma Davis read an appropriate and interesting selection before Crystal Fountain Lodge, last Saturday evening. A good deal of time was taken in making arrangements for our “Annual Supper” which was postponed till Tuesday evening Dec. 30th, and will be held at the residence of Dr. W. C. Gallagher.
