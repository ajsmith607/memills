GOOD TEMPLAR MATTERS.

Compiled for the Journal.

–Members of the Order going to the Grand Lodge will start Monday morning, Aug. 25.

–There was one initiation, and two received by card, at Ithaca Union Lodge one week ago Wednesday evening. They also installed a good corps of officers that evening. Under the good of the order some very encouraging words were given by Rev. and sister Lousbery [sic] of High Bridge lodge.

–Owing to our absence for the last week the Good Templar news for this week will be rather limited. During our absence we have had a chance to learn something about Good Templarism in Orange county. The Orange county lodge met last Thursday in Middletown, and from the reports given we would say that county was doing nicely. For some time back, the order there has been damaging itself and the cause of temperance by internal dissensions. But now they have settled down to the fight against the common foe, and the result is that the Order is doing once more a good work in “Old Orange”. We feel some interest in the cause of Good Templarism there, because it was in the county that we were first led into a Good Templar’s lodge. Since that time, nearly four years ago, we have found what a great and grand order we were a member of and have been led to enter more fully into its work. But we want to say a word right here, in regard to what many call a failure in the workings of our order. The lodge that we first united with, after working a couple of years, went down for various causes. People said that “they told you so,” and “they knew Good Templarism would never amount to anything,” and so on *ad infinitum*. But let us see what that lodge really did do. Last spring a few of the young men who had belonged to the old lodge, and had there had the finest principles, that are so thoroughly taught by our order, fastened indelibly upon their minds, young men who before they entered the lodge were the most careless of the careless in regard to temperance; a few such young men as that got together, called a temperance meeting, nominated a no-license excise commissioner, worked for him at the polls and elected him by a good majority. Can any one say, in the face of such things as these, that any lodge was ever instituted in vain? Nay! but I tell you that no lodge was ever instituted, no matter how short lived it may have been, but that the cause of temperance was advanced. We sometimes get discouraged, and seem to feel when we hear of members leaving the order, that somehow our work has proved a failure. But instead, could we look at it as it really is, we would find that we were meeting in some such cases with our grandest success. And so the sum and substance of the whole matter is that we have every encouragement to work on more energetically than ever.

–The following report is from High Bridge lodge, No. 296, of Motts Corners. We had a good attendance and a splendid meeting, full of interest and pleasure. Every member seemed to be in a humorous mood. This spirit appears characteristic of our lodge. Your correspondent has been a member of High Bridge lodge upwards of two years and has never yet witnessed a hasty or angry discussion. Whenever a question meets opposition, it is discussed good humoredly [sic], and in every instance the minority submits with good grace to the majority. To my mind, harmony is one of the great essentials to the success of a lodge. I think I have read that Napoleon, or some other equally distinguished military being, after inspecting his army just before a battle said “we are in accord.” This seems to apply to us; we are in accord with each other and the cause of temperance. But to return to my subject of Lodge items. Dr. Besemer’s string band was fully reorganized and gave the lodge a rare musical treat. Miss Mills, Messrs. Besemer, Merrill, Graham, and McWhorter furnished entertainment for the good of the order. It is hoped our members will all be present at our meeting, as the appointments are good and a good time may be expected.

–All those expecting to attend Grand Lodge are requested to immediately inform Bro. I. C. Andrews, of Ithaca, of the fact. They will also find it necessary to purchase their tickets at the ticket office of the Ithaca depot of the U. I. & E. R. R. in order to secure the reduced the rates. [sic]
