TEMPERANCE MATTERS

We have been asked for the names of the secretaries of the varies [sic] Good Templar lodges of the county. We give below the list so far as reported. 

Faithful Lodge, No. 63, Mrs. L. J. Townley, North Lansing; Fidelity No. 86, Mrs. Della Stout, McLean; Progress, No. 93, C. B. Bills, Freeville; Diligent, No. 137, Miss Sarah Johnson, Peruville; Crystal Wave, No. 161, C. L. Farrington, Trumansburg; Spring Valley, No. 171, W. F. Jones, Groton; Cascadilla, No. 177, C. D. Preston, Ithaca; Crystal Fountain, No. 234, Miss Frank Davis, Slaterville; Ithaca Union, No. 295, E. F. Wilson, Ithaca; High Bridge, No. 296, Charles Vandermark, Motts Corners; Purity, No. 326, Frank Bailey, Etna; Ivy, No. 341, Giles Ford, Dryden; Speedsville, No. 353, J. M. Parker, Speedsville; Temperance Star, No. 384, T. H. B. Martin, Caroline Center.

We have not yet received any communication from any of the above lodges during the present quarter and hence we have very little in the way of local news to report this week. The new county secretary has not yet had sufficient experience as a newspaper writer to enable him to evolve news out of his own consciousness. Therefore if the Good Templars of the county wish to receive news through this column, it will be necessary for them to report to him promptly any facts of interest with which they may be acquainted. We hope the secretaries named above will bear this in mind. 

H. P. Barnes, P.R.W.G.S. of Ithaca, is attending the Right Worthy Grand Lodge at New York city this week.

Cascadilla Lodge initiated three new members last Saturday evening. This makes eleven initiations in that lodge during May.

Fifty new lodges have been instituted in Maine since last October making an aggregate at the present time of about three hundred in that state.

Twenty-four new lodges were organized in Missouri during the month of February.

Returns from Wisconsin show that the order is growing rapidly in that state. Fifty-four new lodges have been organized during the last five months and the old lodges show a marked increase in membership. 

An amendment to the constitution prohibiting the manufacture and sale of alcoholic liquors in the state has been adopted by the legislature of Iowa.

The great contest of the year, however, is taking place in Kansas. A constitutional amendment which if adopted will establish total prohibition has been submitted to the people and will be voted upon in November. The state is being thoroughly canvassed and organized. The governor predicts that the amendment will be carried by fifty thousand majority.

County Secretary.
