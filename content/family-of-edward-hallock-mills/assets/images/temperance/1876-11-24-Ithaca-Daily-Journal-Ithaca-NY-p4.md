Tuesday evening Nov. 14th a lecture was delivered by A. S. Draper, after which a number were initiated for the Slaterville Lodge. The following questions were very ably discussed during the session, from which those present derived great benefit:

1. Duty of the church as relates to Good Templars.

2. How can we as a County Lodge best keep up the interest and promote the interest in the county?

3. How can we keep up the interest in subordinate Lodges.

4. What is the duty of the Good Templars as relates to juvenile Templars?

The report of the Lodges shows the number to be about the same as last quarter.

Co. Sec’y.
