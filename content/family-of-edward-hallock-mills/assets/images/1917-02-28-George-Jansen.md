  - Ann J. Irey (? to 28 May 1917). "Mrs. J. B. Irey suffered a very severe shock of paralysis and is now in a critical condition." (13 Feb 1917, The Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p7.) George Jansen, in his 1917 journal, gives regular accounts of Mrs. Irey's condition in her final weeks (she "has got a shock" as he put it), including her last night. 07 Apr 1917 is typical: "Mrs. Irey howled all night". And her final day, 28 May 1917: "I sat up all night with Mrs. Irey so Emeline could have a little rest. I expect her to breathe her last any minute. Respiration 30 a minute 2AM. Mrs. Irey died 1:30 PM today." The next day, 29 May 1917: "Digging Mrs. Irey grave today." 30 May 1917: "Mrs. Irey funeral today."
