  - "In religious studies, homiletics... is the application of the general principles of rhetoric to the specific art of public preaching. One who practices or studies homiletics may be called a homilist, or more simply a preacher. Homiletics, the art of preaching, studies both the composition and the delivery of religious discourses. It includes all forms of preaching including sermons, homilies and catechetical instruction. Homiletics may be further defined as the study of the analysis, classification, preparation, composition and delivery of sermons. The formation of the Lyman Beecher course at Yale University resulted in an increased emphasis on homiletics. The published volumes of this series includes information regarding the history and practice of the discipline." [Homiletics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homiletics), Wikipedia.org.)

REV. WM. S. HILLS

Rev Wm. S. Hills, pastor of the Congregational church of this city, crossed the River Friday, October 26, at 5:45 a.m. after a long and painful sickness that has elicited the warm sympathy of the whole community towards him and his family. Mr. Hills was born of English parentage on North River, near Tarrytown, New York, May 16, 1834, and thus was nearly midway between 72 and 73 years of age at the time of his death. His parents were emmigrants from Yarmouth, England and he was reared under the care of a good foster mother, who instilled into his mind in his earliest years the elements of the Christian religion.

Mr. Hills' education for his life work was gained through the common schools of New York, and through the handcrafts of wagon making, baker, and mechanic, a start in life of no mean sort coming to so earnest a soul. In 1854 Mr. Hills married Mrs. Julia Sackett, whom he now leaves a widow of 52 years of wedded life at an age equal to his own. Three children were born of this union, of whom one only, Laura Amelia, together with an adopted grandson, William Walter, survive the death of their father. 

When the war broke out Mr. Hills resided in New York. He answered the call of his country by active service in the South with the Engineer Corps as a bridge-builder, but, somehow or other and unfortunately, without being formally enlisted as a soldier. This fact debarred him from the advantages that come with the wearing of the G. A. R. Button, not the least of which was the eligibility to pension and the right to a soldiers' claim of Government land.

Mr. Hills was reared in an Episcopalian atmosphere, but while still a youth turned to the non-ritualistic religion and worship of the Congregational church. He felt the call to preach and began work as a lay preacher. It was his good fortune to be thrown into the company of the famous Beecher family various members of which took a lively interest in the growing layman and shaped his course in life by superintending the lay-preacher's studies. At different times Mr. Hills recited his studies in Theology and homiletics to James, T. K., Henry Ward or Harriet Beacher. When Mr. Hills was ordained in 1866 at Wellburg, N. Y. into the regular Congregational ministry, it was largely the outcome of the inspiration of the direction of this gifted family.  

The career of Rev. W. S. has been characteristic of frontier times. Very surely upon him has fallen the heat and burden of the day. Could the whole story of Mr. Hills' ministry be told it would rank with the classics of frontier ministry. This partial list of places covered by Mr. Hills' ministry tells a story of strenuous life, of hardships endured as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. Mr. Hills served Congregational churches at Pottersville, Penn., Perry and Bevier, Mo., York Town, Neb., where he and a Methodist circuit rider had the work of four counties divided between them; Hamilton, Verdon, Eagle, Wymore and Alma, Neb.; Garfield, Nickerson, Ochletree, Linwood and Longton, Kansas. Besides these scattered points Mr. Hills had appointments in Texas, and in the Territory and Oklahoma. 

In all this frontier work Mr. Hills was serving under the commission of the Home Missionary Society, and at a salary that never really reached the dignity of a living wage. Had Mr. Hills followed his trade he would doubtless long ago laid up a competency, for he was active, energetic and of the temperament that leads to success in business. But he literally devoted himself to the preaching of the Gospel and sad to relate, as a consequence his widow and daughter are left in destitute circumstances, so far as this worlds goods are concerned. Both are in delicate health and will need the financial assistance of the benevolent. There ought to be some system by which the churches that have thriven on Mr. Hills' life blood in past years might have an opportunity to take care of his family now that he is gone.

Though serving small frontier churches through a long life time Mr. Hills was a forceful and efficient preacher. His pulpit work showed the earmarks of the Beechers, who were his teachers and he was worthy of much wider hearing that circumstances accorded him. The citizens of Longton, without regard to church affiliations, acting generously upon broad humanitarian principles have nobly done their part in the work of relief, and will still do more. The Congregational churches of the state will help the widow and daughter of the deceased. 

Rev. Arthur Metcalf, Independence, Ks.
