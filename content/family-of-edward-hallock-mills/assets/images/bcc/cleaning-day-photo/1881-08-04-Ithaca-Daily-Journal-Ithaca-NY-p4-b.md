MOTT'S CORNERS. 

Business at this place is quite active; a number of dwellings are in process of erection and there is a brisk demand for mechanics. 

The three woolen factories, one of which has been built and the other two enlarged, the present season are in full operation. One of them is employing or about to employ sixty or seventy hands. 

A deep gloom is at present resting on this place caused by the death last Wednesday of Richard Lounsberry, Esq., one of the quiet and solid men of this place. Born and reared in this village, an earnest Christian, loved and respected by all who knew him. He had been in feeble health for a number of years yet the immediate cause of his death was paralysis. He leaves a wife but no children. M.
