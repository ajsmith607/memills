SON ADMINISTRATOR OF PARENTSâ€™ ESTATES 

Milton J. Gorsline was this morning named administrator of the estate of his mother, Emma Gorsline, who died May 14, and of his father, Alonzo Gorsline, who died Nivember 13, 1914, in the court of County Surrogate Monroe M. Sweetland. Papers had previously been filed naming Emma Gorsline administratrix of the estate of Alonzo Gorsline, but she died before they reached her, so the son now becomes administrator of both estates, having a total valuation of approximately $2,000.

The Alonzo Gorsline estate is valued at $100 in personal property and $900 in real property while the estate of Emma Gorsline is valued at $600 in personal property and $400 in real property.
