OBITUARY

JOHN L. MANDEVILLE.

John L. Mandeville, a native and life long resident of the town of Caroline died last evening at his home near Brookton of apoplexy, aged 71 years. He was stricken a week ago today, became unconscious on Wednesday and remained in that condition until he passed away.

Mr. Mandeville was a well-to-do and well known farmer, but obtained prominence in his town, and throughout the country as well, chiefly by his efforts in behalf of the good roads movement. For years, with voice and pen he advocated road betterment with an insistence and faith that never wavered. Tuesday before his last illness began he was out watching the surveyors at work on the projected new "good road" in Caroline, and offering suggestions relative to the matter. Mr. Mandeville was a member of the Congregational Church of Brookton. In politics he was a Republican.

He was also a veteran of the Civil War, a member of David Ireland Post, G. A. R., and likewise an active Granger, being a member of Brookton Grange and of the Tompkins County Pomona Grange.

He is survived by his widow and one son, Robert. His funeral will be held on Monday Dec. 2 at 1 p.m. Burial will take place in Quick Cemetery.
