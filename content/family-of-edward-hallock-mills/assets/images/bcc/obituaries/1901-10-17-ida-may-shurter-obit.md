BROOKTON.

–Departed this life, on Thursday evening, Oct. 17th, Ida M. Shurter, aged 42 years, 6 months Miss Shurter had undergone an operation for the removal of a cystic tumor, on Monday, and was too weak to endure the shock to the nervous system, and the flame of life that burned so feebly suddenly fluttered out. A host of friends, by all of whom she was held in highest esteem, mourn her loss. She was one of those rare souls, loved by many and spoken ill of by none. Her death seems like a dream more than like the sad reality. Six brothers and an only sister are left. By the sister the loss will be felt the most keenly, as the two had always resided together, never having been separated for scarcely a week at one time. Miss Clara has the sincere sympathy of a host of friends. The funeral was held from her late home on Sunday, PM., Rev. Evily C. Woodruff, her pastor, officiating. Burial in Cantine cemetery. The remains were laid to rest in a beautiful casket literally strewn with flora tributes from her friends.
