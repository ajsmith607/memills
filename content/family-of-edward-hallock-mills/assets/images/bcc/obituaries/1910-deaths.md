Mrs. Amanda Latta Griffith wife of Thomas H. Griffith died Feb 3, 1910 at her home in Grand Rapids, Mich. She was also one of our Charter Members. On their removal to Mich a good many years ago, they did not take letter preferring to remain members of this Ch. Her husband still has his membership here. 

Removed by letter Mrs. Julia A. Piatt asked for a letter from this Church, that she might unite with the First Congregational Church of Ithaca N. Y. the 1st Sunday in Oct 1910. Her home is in that city. In making the request she writes, "I shall always have a very kindly feeling for the dear old Church of our Fathers and Mothers".
