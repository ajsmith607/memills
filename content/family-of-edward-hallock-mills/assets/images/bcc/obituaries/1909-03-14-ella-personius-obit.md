    - [Reverend Allen Beach Woodworth](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/66215938/allen-beach-woodworth) (04 Jun 1837 to 11 Sep 1910), whose obituary in the Ithaca Daily News (12 Sep 1910, p3) states was the long-time pastor of the Brookton Baptist Church. This was a transition period between pastors for the Congregational Church, and in both the Ithaca Daily News and the historical records of Caroline Valley Federated Church, Reverend Woodworth is noted as performing Sunday services at the Congregational Church as well as officiating funerals for Congregation members during this time, presumably helping out in his retirement. Church records are vague on the point, but it's quite likely he helped out irregularly over many months as the Congregational Church needed his services.

Her obituary states that she was "the first woman ever ordained a minister in the Congregational Church". (12 Jun 1946, The Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p3.)

BROOKTON. 

DEATH OF MRS. W. V. PERSONIUS. 

Mrs. Ella M. Personius, wife of Capt. W. V. Personius, died at 2 P. M. on Sunday, March 14th. Death was due to stomach trouble from which she had suffered many years. She was in her 70th year. She leaves her husband and one daughter, Mrs. W. G. Besemer, at whose home at Besemer’s her death occurred. The funeral was largely attended from her daughter’s home on Tuesday, the Rev. A. B. Woodworth, of Brookton, and Mrs. F. E. Bates, of Ithaca, officiating. The interment was in the West Slaterville cemetery. Mrs. Personius was held in high esteem for her many good qualities and will be greatly missed by a large circle of friends not only in Brookton, where she made her home for a good many years, but in Ithaca, where she had been spending the winter. Attorney Edward N. Jackson and wife and Mrs. Julia Piatt, of Park Place, Ithaca, were in town to attend the funeral of Mrs. W. V. Personius on Tuesday.
