RESIDENTS OF CAROLINE LOSE POPULAR CITZIEN [sic] 

**Death of Edward Lounsbery Widly[sic] Mourned by Neighbors and Townsmen—Born in Brookton About 71 Years Ago—Ancestors Prominent in Early History of Ulster County and in the Revolution.** 

The sudden death of Edward Lounsbery of Brookton on Sunday was a shock to the feelings of his Caroline neighbors and townsmen among whom his whole life had been pleasantly and usefully spent excepting a few years absence in the army in the war of the Rebellion. He was a genial, kindly man and a true gentleman. 

He was born in Brookton about 71 years ago, His farther, Peter Lounsbery came from the town about 1828. He was a tanner by trade and carried on the business for many years. He came from Marbletown, Ulster county, about the time or shortly after the emigration of his father-in-law, the first Charles Cantine. 

**Firm Organized.** 

Mr. Lounsbery was one of the wealthy citizens of Caroline, was supervisor, justice of the peace and back in the early '40's [?] was member of assembly for one term. 

After retiring from the tanning business his son, who has just passed away, succeeded him and the firm of Lounsbery & Ryan carried on the trade several years. The partner was John Ryan who later conducted an extensive business in Candor and is still a resident of Caroline. 

Mr. Lounsbery was one of a family of three brothers, of whom only Cantine Lounsbery is now living, a younger brother, Richard, having died about 20 years ago.  

The Lounsbery and Cantine families, ancestors of the deceased, were among the oldest, long resident and respected families of Ulster county. General John Cantine was the great-grandfather of the deceased and, besides being very prominent in the Revolution, was the fore-runner and founder of the settlement of the town of Caroline where he died in 1808. He is buried at Brookton. M.
