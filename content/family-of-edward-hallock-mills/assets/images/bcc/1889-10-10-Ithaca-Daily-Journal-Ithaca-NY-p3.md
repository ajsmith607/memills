BROOKTON.

Evening services in the Congregational church will hereafter be at 7 o'clock. 

Charles Hazen has the frame for his hew residence on Railroad avenue nearly completed. 

G. Barnard and daughter, of Corning, are the guests of Mr. and Mrs. Cantine Lounsberry. 

Dr Leonard, who came among us last spring, has decided to leave this place and locate in New Milford, Pa. He has gained the confidence and respect of the people here during his short stay, and it is with a good deal of regret that they see him go. 

Albert Keeler, who had been sick for several weeks, died at his residence here last Friday morning. The funeral was held at the Congregational church Saturday afternoon, He was an honored member of Caroline Lodge No. 631 F. & A. M., and the beautiful and impressive burial service of that order was used, the members of the craft turning out in a body. 

Rev. A. B. Woodworth preached his farewell sermon last Sunday to a crowded house. The church of which be has been pastor so long will find it very difficult to secure any one to fill his place. He has really been a pastor to the whole community, ever standing ready to lend a helping hand to those who were in trouble, whereever [sic] they were. The well-wishes of all the Brookton people will go with him to his future home. 

A movement, which originated in the Brookton grange, is agitating the minds of the farmers of Caroline, by which they intend to do all in their power to elect men to the coming legislature Who will pledge themselves to use their influence to have the tax laws of the state so amended that personal property shall bear its share of taxation, and also to do what they can to secure such amendments to the ballot laws as will prevent to some extent, at least, the buying and selling of votes.
