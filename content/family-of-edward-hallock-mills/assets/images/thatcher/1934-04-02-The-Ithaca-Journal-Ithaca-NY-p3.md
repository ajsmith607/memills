Dr. Smith, 67, Coroner Here 17 Years, Dies

**First Took Office Jan. 1, 1916—Was Health Officer of Town of Newfield for 25 Years—Health Began to Fail About 8 Years Ago**

Dr. William A. Smith, 67, coroner of Tompkins County since Jan. 1, 1916, and for many years before that health officer of the Town of Newfield, died at his home, 308 Lake Avenue at 10 o’clock Saturday night, Mar. 31, following a [l]ong illness.

Doctor Smith was born at Catherine[sic] Schuyler County, on Feb. 1, 186[?] and graduated from the Dundee High School. He studied medicine for two years at the University of Michigan and later attended the Long Island Hospital College from which he graduated in 1889.

After graduation, Doctor Smith began practice at Geneva. Six years later he moved to Newfield where he practiced for 35 years. During 25 years of that time he served as health officer.

Doctor Smith became a Republican candidate for the office of county coroner in the fall of 1915 and was elected over Dr. A. A. Chase. His term was for three years and he was re-elected at every election since, on several occasions having the Democratic endorsement as well as the Republican. He was re-elected last year over Dr. M. J. Foran.

**Underwent Operation**

Eight years ago Doctor Smith’s health began to fail and he went to New York where he underwent a major operation. The operation was successful and he had been in good health until about a year ago when he removed to Ithaca.

Besides his widow, Doctor Smith is survived by two daughters, Mrs. Agnes Shulman of Ithaca and Mrs. Alliene Esterbrook of Newfield; seven grandchildren of Newfield; his mother, Mrs. Olive A. Smith of Odessa and one sister, Mrs. Clarence Hausner of Odessa.

Private funeral services will be held at the family home, 308 Lake Avenue, at 2 o’clock Wednesday afternoon, Apr. 4. The Rev. Henry P. Horton, rector of St. John’s Episcopal Church, will officiate. Interment will be in Laurel Cemetery at Odessa.

Doctor Smith was a past master of King Hiram, Lodge, F. and A. Masons of Newfield.
