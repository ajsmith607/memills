WILLIAM A. WHEELOCK DEAD. 

Was the President of the Council of New York University. 

Willlam A. Wheelock, President of the Council of New York University, died yesterday morning at his Summer home, Easthampton, L. I. Sixty-two years ago he was graduated from New York University at the age of eighteen. He was a member of the Council twenty-seven years, and in 1898 he became its President. He was Treasurer of the university for fifteen years. 

Born in Providence, R. I., Mr. Wheelock came to New York City when he was twelve years old. He entered the grammar school of the university. After two years there he entered the university, and in four years had completed the course. Most of this time he supported himself by teaching in the grammar school. Going into the mercantile business after his graduation, he prospered steadily. In 1862, when he was thirty-seven years old, he retired with a fortune. 

But Mr. Wheelock was a man of affairs, and he could not stay idle long. In 1864 he became a Director in the Central National Bank. Two years later he was its President. In 1881 he resigned this office and began to devote his time to philanthropic work and the New York University. At the same time he was a Director in several large corporations. He was an Elder in the Presbyterian Church and a Director of the Union Theological Seminary. 

Mr. Wheelock belonged to the New England Society, the Union League, the Lawyers’ Club, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the American Museum of Natural History, and the American Fine Arts Society. The corporations in which he was a Director are the Equitable Life Assurance Society, the Gold and Stock Telegraph Company, the Citizens’ Central National Bank, and the Ophthalmic and Aural Institute. He was a Trustee of the American Surety Company.
