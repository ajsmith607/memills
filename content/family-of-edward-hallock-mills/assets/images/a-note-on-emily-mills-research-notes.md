POST OFFICE #3

In 1961, Postmaster Charles Vorhis bought Jessie Brewer's store and moved the post office [Location #3] across the street [from location #2, at Tucker's Store]. This store had been Mr. Mills' dry goods store and was carried on for thirty years after his death by his daughter Emily Mills, who carried kerosene, kerosene lamps with green shades, penny candy, stockings, handkerchiefs, yard goods, pins and sewing notions, sheets and pillowcases (and some groceries?). [Driveby, ie Conant] Emily Mills died in 1937. Jessie Brewer, who grew up in the house next door as Jessie Shurter, kept a dry goods store here after Miss Mills died and had a lending library in the back of the store. [1944 Caroline phone directory: "Dry Goods, Notions & Blankets" CH p. 101] The Shurter House, which sat between the post office and the bridge, was moved to 447 Brooktondale Road in 1964 when the road through Brooktondale was improved.

MARY EMILY MILLS, known as Emily, was born in 1861 and died in 1937. In the 1892 census she is listed as a "clerk" in her father's store [CH 93] Later she was listed as a "merchant." Her obituary notes that she kept a general store for about 30 years. [CH, p. 146]

EDWARD H. MILLS died January 1, 1908, without a will, leaving a widow Hannah and a daughter M. Emily. Emily was appointed to administer his estate, which was settled August 2, 1909. Mr. Mills left "stock and accounts of a going, general merchandise business in the village of Brookton" valued at $6000, and a parcel known as "the Mills Store lot", valued at $500. [papers in Surrogate Records, Ithaca]

This sewing booklet, issued in 1909, represents Emily Mills' first attempt at advertising after she took over the store after her father's death.
