FURTHER TRIBUTES 

TO THE MEMORY OF MR. WARREN. 

His Associates on the Press Speak of Him—A Sad Meeting of the Press Club—The Republican League Also Mourns the Loss of a Member. 

The Buffalo Press Club held a meeting on Saturday to adopt resolutions of sympathy with the family of Mr. Warren. 

President Kingsley spoke in very touching terms of the death of a member of the profession: 

“Our dear friend,” said he, “will ever be remembered as a man who did his utmost and succeeded in the effort of making a newspaper what it ought to be. There are those here who knew him longer and more intimately than I did, who are better able to speak of him, too, so I will conclude by appointing a committee on resolutions, and for that purpose I will appoint Mr. Bennett of the Times, Mr. White of the News, and Mr. Ferris of the Courier. And while the committee is occupied we would, I am sure, like to hear expressions from those present. 

George E. Matthews of the Express was the first speaker, and he said it was hard for him to speak about Mr. Warren, for they had been friends from boyhood, and in Many respects Mr. Warren had acted as his elder brother. 

“Certainly,” said he, “no one could have been kinder or more helpful than he was to me. When we became men our affairs in life were separate, but I do not think that either of us ever forgot our old friendship and personally our friendship was always of the sincerest kind. 

“He was essentially a very high-toned gentleman, true to his principles, and he has been so suddenly taken away from us that it is hard to recognize that fact. When he took one side of a question there never was any doubt in his mind, and his party, his friends and his paper got the most unfaltering service from him always.” 

“Gentlemen,” said Edwin Fleming of the Courier, “for my own experience I May say that from the time I came to Buffalo I enjoyed the warm personal friendship of Mr. Warren. I came to know him as a straightforward, sagacious man; a man of uncommon intensity of purpose, and like all men of that kind, while full of his purpose, he was courteous, kind, and always a friend to be looked to.” 

Norman E. Mack said that he could not add anything to what had been already said. O. G. Warren was a friend of his, had always been, and he mourned his loss that day. 

“No man,” said he, “was more manly and more loyal to a friend than was Warren, and we have all cause to regret his sad death.” 

Arthur W. Austin, city editor of the COMMERCIAL, spoke briefly, expressing the sense of personal bereavement felt by the entire staff on the death of Mr. Warren. 

At this stage the committee on resolutions announced themselves and on being called on by President Kingsley, Mr. Ferris read the following resolutions: 

The Buffalo Press Club had hoped to be spared for many years the record of death which this day compels. 

Orsamus G. Warren's great activity and well balanced energies conveyed the constant assurance of many added years of usefulness and of successes further to bless his family and all with whom association could not fail to benefit. 

The club speaks with gratitude of Mr. Warren’s active relations with this fraternity and in appreciation of his abiding interest and thoughtfulness for its well-being. He was proud of the newspaper as an institution and was zealous 1n advancing its standard and promoting its influence for good. His advice to those with whom he was associated was ever a counseling to better endeavor. His friendship was something to be highly prized and sacredly preserved. His qualities of mind and heart were understood only to be admired. The impress of his example will be one of enduring force upon the press of this city and state. Words are indeed inadequate to express the emotions of sorrow that we feel or the deep sympathy we have for those who were nearest to him in the holy relations of the home. We have lost a good friend and safe adviser, and his memory we shall ever revere. 

It is directed that this tribute be spread upon the records of this club, and that copies hereof be sent to Mr. Warren's family and to the newspapers of Buffalo. 

The resolutions were agreed to and the meeting concluded. 

THE REPUBLICAN LEAGUE. 

There was a very large attendance of the Republican League on Saturday night, and the members assembled to show their grief at the death of Mr. Warren. 

President Scatcherd in calling the meeting to order said that by a close connection with Mr. Warren he had ascertained the depth of his character. 

“He was to me,” said the President, “a true and honorable friend, and this club and all the members of it recognized him as an honest man and a friend.” 

Arthur W. Hickman and Martin Clark also spoke of the loss sustained by the death of Mr. Warren. 

“He has performed services for the Republican party,” said Judge Hatch, “which can never be forgotten. He was loyal to his friends, loyal to his party, a true friend, and one whose loss will be deeply felt in all circles of this city.” 

George S. Hull, Charles K. Robinson, and Edward C. Volger, who were appointed to draft resolutions, brought in the following which were agreed to in silence: 

Whereas, We of the Buffalo Republican League feel that by the sudden death of the Hon. Orsamus G. Warren, in the very prime of life, full of splendid achievement and rich promise, a man valued and trusted in the councils of the great party to which we owe allegiance, beyond any of his townsmen, the community has sustained a deep and memorable loss, and we are deprived of the advice and assistance of one of our most prominent associate members; 

Resolved, That we express the feeling of appreciation for his life and work which must animate us as we recall his many services as a citizen and a statesman,to the State and Nation, but more particularly to this city, which he loved as his home. While we know that he he has so identified himself with her history that his name will be carried to future generations whenever the tale of her development is told, and that it needs no formal tribute to keep his memory green in the minds of those who live today, we would express our admiration for his genius and those rare qualities of mind and character which fitted him by nature tor the position of leadership which so long he held; and we would extend our sincere sympathy to his bereaved family and those who are more nearly called to mourn. To this end it is directed that these resolutions be spread upon the minutes of the League. 

Many personal expressions of condolence were forwarded to the family from members of the club. 

ACTION OF THE AMERICAN EXCHANGE BANE. 

At a special meeting of the Board of Directors of the American Exchange Bank of Buffalo, held the 7th day of May, 1892, the following memorial on the death of Mr. Orsamus G. Warren, which occurred on May 6th, 1892, was unanimously adopted: 

It is the painful duty of the Directors of this bank to record upon minutes the death of Orsamus G. Warren. In so doing they attest his faithfulness and zeal in the discharge of his trust, his ability, his integrity, his good judgment and wise counsel; but beyond all this they personally deplore the loss of an associate and companion, whose geniality of Nature and kindliness of spirit made his presence in-their midst seem always like sunshine, and they are filled with sorrow at the loss of a friend whose loyalty knew no bounds. 

They extend to his bereaved family their sincere sympathy in their greatest sorrow.

In Memoriam.  
O. G. W., May 9, 1892. 
<br/>
When he, the Elder Friend, was called away, 
  To thee our bond of fealty became 
A heritage of his paternal away, 
  As vital as his honored name and fame. 
<br/>
Thine then became the firm and guiding hand, 
  The one appeal, the word of mastery; 
And thou dids’t come to know and understand 
  The test of an unswerving loyalty. 
<br/>
Though now, alas! the twice-cemented bond, 
  Is parted by an unrelenting power, 
"Tis knit anew because our hearts respond, 
  Unto the sacred duties of the hour. 
<br/>
Farewell, brave, dauntless soul! Forever more . 
  Dwell thou in realms of peace and fadeless light! 
While we who loved thee prove, as once before, 
  That Death can consecrate as well as smite! 
<br/>
A.W. A.
