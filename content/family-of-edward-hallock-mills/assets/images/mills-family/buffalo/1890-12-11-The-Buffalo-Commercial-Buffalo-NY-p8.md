ROBERT MILLS IS DEAD 

END OF A LONG AND USEFUL LIFE. 

Sketch of His Career on the Lakes and as a Builder of Vessels—His Pelitical Life and Service as Police Commissioner—Personal Characteristics. 

Ex-Police Commissioner: Robert Mills, died at his residence on Prospect avenue, at 5:25 this morning. The immediate cause of death was a stroke of apoplexy, which he sustained on Monday evening last. He became unconscious, and so continued to the end. Mr. Mills had been an invalid for the past eight years, owing largely to the effects of a stroke of paralysis. 

Robert Mills was the son of Scotch parents, who emigrated to Canada in 1823. He was born Noy. 17, 1824, in Toronto, where his early boyhood was spent. He came to Buffalo when twelve years of age and shipped as a cabin boy on the schooner John E. Hunt, running between Buffalo and Chicago. He rose by degrees, and at the early age of 21 years he was given the position of master of the brig Uncle Sam. Afterwards he became half owner of the brig Philadelphia, his first venture in ownership, and he was made master of the vessel. He followed life on the lakes with considerable success, becoming in turn master of the schooner George Davis, the brig Hampton and schooner Hope. He was owner of the latter vessel and part owner of the Kate L. Bruce. He built the schooner P. P. Pratt and sailed it for six years. In 1855 he quit sailing and went into business on land. He and Patrick Walsh, forming the firm of Mills & Walsh, started a shipyard. They bought out the shipyard and drydock of F. N. Jones in 1866, the firm then being Mills & Co., the partners being Mr. Mills, Mr. Walsh,and John Rice. Mr. Walsh died in 1875, but his heirs continued his interest in the firm. 

Until about eight years ago, when his health failed, Mr. Mills was one of the most prominent builders and operators in lake vessels at this port. His firm was very successful. They ran two large docks and built many of the finest vessels on the lakes. Among them are the Wyoming, Monteagle, Robert Mills, Florida, and others.  

But it was not alone in ship-building that Mr. Mills achieved distinction. He went into politics in 1859, obtaining the election of alderman on the republican ticket in the Eighth ward in spite of the fact that the ward was then democratic by 300. He was re-elected in 1861 and defeated by eleven votes in 1863. He was a good republican and an excellent alderman. In 1861 President Lincoln appointed him steamboat inspector for this district and he held the position four years. 

Captain Mills was chairman of the Republican County Committee from 1868 to 1874, serving with credit to himself and his party. In 1871-2 he was Canal Collector at this port. Mayor Brush appointed him Police Commissioner upon the reorganization of the Police Department in 1880. In this position he was best known to the younger men of the city, though his old comrades of the deck and dock never quite got the hang of calling him “Commissioner.” It was plain "Captain" with them. Captain Mills’ career as a member of the Police Board was an honorable one, He was a faithful official, and it was largely through him that the Buffalo Police Department was brought to a high state of efficiency. He continued in office during the term of Grover Cleveland as Mayor, and when the latter became Governor the police law was repealed. 

Captain Mills was married in 1845 to Margaret A. Cherry, of Chautauqua county. Three children were born to them— two sons and one daughter. All are living, His wife also survives him. 

In religion Captain Mills was a Presbyterian, treading in the footsteps of his Scottish parents. He attended Lafayette street church. He was a member of Hiram Lodge, F. & A. M., also of Buffalo Chapter, and Hugh de Payens Commandery. 

Captain Mills was bluff and hearty in manner, very frank and outspoken. He never "beat about the bush" in his transactions with men. He was honorable in all his dealings. He won respect and confidence from all with whom he came in contact. The friendships he made lasted through his life, and it will be a grief in many Buffalo homes today to learn that Robert Mills is dead.
