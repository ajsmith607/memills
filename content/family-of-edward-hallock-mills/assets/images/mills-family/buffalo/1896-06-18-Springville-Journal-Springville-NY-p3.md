Thomas Mills, an elderly gentleman who spent his summers here for his health died suddenly in Dr. Batesâ€™s grove Wednesday afternoon. He spent much of his time walking and enjoying our delightful scenery. He boarded at the Bates Sanitarium. Lately he had interested himself in preparing a croquet ground in the grove. Yesterday afternoon he went thither, and not returning at tea time Dr. Bates went to call him. He was lying on the ground dead. The cause of death is not known. He was about 67 years old, a man of pleasant manner, esteemed by all who knew him. He made his home, winters, with his brother in Buffalo.
