  - [George Eugene Priest](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/166640109/george-eugene-priest) (25 Jun 1848 to 07 Jan 1921). "Mr. Priest came to Ithaca a lad of 15, from Auburn, in 1863. In 1877, he, with Charles M. Benjamin and George M. Wood, entered into partnership with John H. Selkreg in the ownership of The Ithaca Journal. In 1878 Mr. Sold his stock to the other partners and in 1880 Mr. Selkreg retired, disposing of his interest to Messrs. Priest and Benjamin, who became sole owners of the property. From 1877 to 1912, 35 years, one-third of the life of this paper, and nearly one-half of his own life span, George E. Priest was editor and part owner of The Ithaca Journal, an important, influential and always helpful figure in Ithaca affairs. Under the editorial direction of Mr. Priest The Journal grew steadily in influence and popularity in this city and county. In the centennial number of this newspaper published in 1915, Mr. Priest said of The Journal that it “has lived this long and thrived because its adherents, the bulk of the people of Ithaca and Tompkins County have deemed it worthy. It has consistently sought under its several publishers to be fair, candid, and progressive.” Never more so then when he was at the helm. … He represented in Ithaca the last of what may be called the journalists of the old school.” (08 Jan 1921, The Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p4, newspapers.com.)

**Editorial Tributes.** 

From the Times, 

This community scarcely knew of the dangerous illness of its good friend, Mr. Orsamus George Warren, before the startling announcement of his death brings bereavement to the hearts of all. It is not likely that one tenth of his city friends, who include its entire population, was conscious that this neighbor had passed through quick, painful illness to a release which visits untold loss to hearts and homes—whose special grief none can invade by words—and which terminates choicest associations and kindest relationship with many admiring friends. Mr. Warren’s sad death came this morning at a quarter past nine o’clock. His serious illness began last Saturday. His condition had been critical during every intervening day. 

From the News. 

Orsamus G. Warren, senior proprietor of the BUFFALO COMMERCIAL, died this morning at his home on North street. The news was not unexpected, From midday yesterday his recovery Was pronounced hopeless. The attack of pneumonia under which he was suffering had progressed too far to be successfully controlled. Attempts to feed the lungs with oxygen produced no benefit and later only temporary relief was had from an operation to relieve the organ by blood-letting. Mr. Warren was some better in the evening but failed during the night and passed away soon after 9 o’clock this morning. 

Mr.Warren’s death will be widely lamented. He had, what every earnest and manly man in his position must have, a large circle of friends, and he deserved their kindliest regard. There is more than the conventional tribute to the prominent dead in the earnest words which will be said of him by the press and the public men who knew him. The head of a great newspaper holds a position capable of greater usefulness and of greater harmfulness, perhaps, than any other man in the community. Mr. Warren upheld honorable traditions. He conducted the COMMERCIAL on useful lines. Whatever improvements in presentation of news or in mechanical style were adopted, the dignity and sincerity which characterized it were never lost. 

In his political relations Mr. Warren had the rare success of keeping the esteem of those who differed with him both in and out of his own party. He bore the burden of official party responsibility with moderation and good temper, alike in success and in defeat. He will be remembered in all relations kindly, as a warm friend, a practical, earnest man of affairs and a conservative and tolerant political leader. 

From the Enquirer. 

The death of O. G. Warren is the occasion of profound sorrow in this community. Close upon the news of his serious illness follows the announcement of his death. After a sickness of but a few days he has been called away. The suddenness of his death intensifies the grief of his friends and associates. 

O.G. Warren was a man of many friendships. The shadow of a great sorrow will rest heavily today upon the many who were embraced in the wide circle of his love. 

As editor and as political leader Mr. Warren occupied a conspicuous position. In both capacities he exhibited attributes totally lacking in the ordinary man. He succeeded his father as leader of his party in Western New York. To follow successfully in the footsteps of a man of forceful individuality and of strong purpose, to take up the work and follow the policy outlined by a great leader, require an uncommon capacity for affairs. 

The mantle which fell upon the shoulders of O G. Warren was worthily worn. Especially is this apparent when the changed conditions which the rapid progress of events forced upon him are taken into consideration. 

The life of O..G. Warren was replete with activity. The tireless man of affairs was never idle. He was emphatically a public man. He was in public life from his early manhood until his death. 

Now that he has gone a conscientious judgment will be passed upon his abilities and character. The rivalries of the political forum will not obscure the truth. In that final summary he will appear the skilful leader, the able editor, the true friend, the manly man. 

BUFFALO REPUBLICAN LEAGUE. 

A special meeting of the Buffalo Republican League has been called for Saturday evening at 8 o’clock, to take action on the death of Mr. Warren. 

THE FUNERAL. 

The funeral services will be held on Monday afternoon at 2.30 at the residence on North street.  

It is the desire of the family that no floral offerings be sent.
