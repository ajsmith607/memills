At Rest. 

We said on the morning when the message from Mr. Warren’s death-bed reached us that he “was a man of varied interests and activities; that whatever he did was done thoroughly, with too much zeal, and that he will be missed sadly in many fields of usefulness where he played a leading part. But of these things others, with whom he worked until he fell, spent and exhausted, may speak.” The COMMERCIAL’S columns, filled with loving, admiring and sincere tributes to Mr. Warren’s character, kindliness, and worth as a man and citizen have since then testified more effectively than could any words of ours how large and honorable a place our friend and chief filled in this city and in this commonwealth. These proofs of the peculiarly affectionate regard in which Mr. Warren was held by the busy men of the press, of the exchange, of the bank; by his party colleagues, his political opponents and a multitude of friends who had learned to like and trust him, are very gratefully appreciated by his family and his associates, and will be a precious heritage to his children. 

Today our friend will be laid at rest. On the day he gave up and went home—one week ago last Friday—he said to a friend in the office: “I am tired out. I'm going home and shall not come back until I am rested.” He will not come back. He is at rest—and may God rest his brave soul!

He turned his head,—beside him stood 
  A man whose face was pale but fair; 
Whose quiet eyes like starlight shone 
  From out his dark and misty hair: 
    “Thy prayer is heard,” he said. 
<br/>
“But thou art Death,—thy name is writ 
  Upon thy still and smileless face,— 
I prayed tor peace,—why art thou here? 
  What bringeth thee to seek this place? 
    I prayed for peace,” he said. 
<br/>
“Thy prayer is heard,” the angel said,  
  “Men pray for peace, yet Death would shun, 
Not seeing, with their blinded eyes, 
  That Death and Peace are ever one. 
    Thy prayer is heard,” he said.

Warm and Appreciative Expressions from Mr. Warren’s Friends of the State Press. 

From the Utica Observer. 

This comes close! Death strikes very near! It uncloses a hand-clasp right here! 

Quickly has walked our friend out of familiar scenes and to be forevermore among the silent. A fortnight ago he was with the principal newspaper men of the State in annual meeting in New York, presiding over them, active, persuasive, useful; last week in Albany at the Republican State Convention, a leader among leaders, zealous and hopeful, and taking a commission to the National Convention at Minneapolis; at home again this week, smiling ready answer to ready welcome; then stricken, and after a few brief hours gone! 

These three references to his recent movements hint at the things he was, the things he loved, the things he did in life—outside of his home. First he was a newspaperman. He came up to that estate by his father’s side—by the side of a rare father, for such was James D. Warren—who inducted his son successively into journalism of an admirable sort, then into politics, and transferred to him at death the mantle of undisputed leadership in the County of Erie, and concurrently placed upon his shoulders and in his hands the responsibilities and substance of accumulated wealth and the open opportunities of enhancing it. The years can be counted on one’s fingers since the most of this came to O. G. Warren. He pushed on the newspaper, the BUFFALO COMMERCIAL to increased deserving in public estimation; he held the attachment of the party as his father had done; and he was singularly fortunate in investments coupled to Buffalo’s growth and the promotion of it, so that he lays down a fortune larger than that which fell to his brother and himself at a date comparatively recent. 

To have done so much, to have filled spheres so important and filled them so well, and yet not to have reached his 46th birthday, forms a record of achievement and possession such as few acquire. 

The best of it was that a young heart and strong attachments and open ways went with it all, helped it all, were potent elements in it all. And here is the secret of friendships that bleed today wherever Orsamus George Warren was known. 

From the Buffalo Sunday Truth. 

In his relation towards the public as head of a great organ of public opinion, it is difficult to speak too highly of Mr. Warren. He aimed at producing a clean, family newspaper and a fair political one, while in the collection of legitimate news he ever sought to stimulate the best efforts of the staff to whom its general conduct was confided. The COMMERCIAL has always been on the right side of progressive public movements. Every good cause has had its aid. It has preached the straight republican faith at all times, always accepting the dictum of the councils of the party, and sinking its own preferences at times in its loyalty to the whole body. Such unwavering loyalty is as difficult as the declaring of independence, but it was the only sort that Mr. Warren could comprehend. 

As a party leader he sacrificed himself without stint. Seeking nothing for himself, he gave his time and money freely to advance the interests of the cause in which he believed. His last political work was of a pacificatorv character, trying to weld together the two wings of the republicanism of Erie county for united action in the great campaign of the year.  

A high principled man, blameless in every relation of life, Orsamus G. Warren will go to the grave sincerely mourned by all who know how to appreciate manly worth. 

From the Rochester Post-Express. 

Orsamus G. Warren in all the widely different fields of his activity displayed such ability and was so courteous and kind that the number of his friends equalled the number of those who knew him.

There were many who differed from Mr. Warren in politics and he had some sharp competitors in business; but all of them admired and respected him, and are now paying the sincerest tributes to his memory. In his death Buffalo loses an estimable and popular citizen—one who labored unceasingly to increase the prosperity and extend its reputation—and our esteemed contemporary the Buffalo COMMERCIAL, loses the honored chief who advanced it to the very front rank of afternoon newspapers. 

From the New York Press. 

Mr. O. G. Warren of the BUFFALO COMMERCIAL, who died in that city after a brief illness yesterday, succeeded his father, who was an eminent republican, in the principal ownership and editorship of that leading Western New York newspaper about seven years ago. He was a man of warm attachment to friends, and was the recognized republican leader in Erie county at the time of his death. 

From the Buffalo Real Estate News. 

In the death of Orsamus G. Warren, senior proprietor of the Buffalo COMMERCIAL, this city loses a business man and political leader of marked ability. Mr.Warren has been a hard worker in his business of managing a newspaper and was doubtless iily prepared to combat so dangerous a disease as typhoid pneumonia with which he was stricken. The life work of Mr. Warren is too well known to need extended eulogy. His presence will be sorely missed in many quarters where he was an important figure. He was a man of strict business habits, a firm friend, and a genial companion. 

On account of the funeral of Mr. O. G, Warren, senior proprietor of the COMMERCIAL, which takes place at half-past two o’clock this afternoon, but one edition of the COMMERCIAL will be published today. It will be issued at noon and will be delivered to all subscribers.
