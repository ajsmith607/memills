A GREAT LOSS. 

Death of Mr. James D, Warren—His Eventful Life.

After several weeks of suffering, James D. Warren departed this life, Friday evening. The cause of death was inflammation of the bladder, his father having died from the same malady. Several hours before the end came, an operation was performed, to relieve a swelling near the groin. It was expected that he would improve after the operation, but an hour afterward he began to sink rapidly.

The history of the deceased was in many respects a remarkable one. Born on a farm in Bennington,  N. Y., January 19, 1823, his parents early removed to Clarence, this county. His father kept the village store, and young Warren alternately worked on the farm and in the store. At the age of 19 he made a tour of the southern states. Returning to Clarence, his neighbors elected him to represent the town in the Board of Supervisors. He was re-elected several times, and in 1854 he was elected county treasurer. Afterward he was thrice elected clerk of the Board of Supervisors. In 1861, with Messrs. Joseph Wheeler and Joseph Candee, he purchased the *Commercial Advertiser.* The following year Mr. James N. Matthews succeeded Mr. Candee, and in 1864 Mr. Candee retired, the firm remaining as Matthews & Warren until 1877, when Mr. Matthews retired. Under Mr. Warren's able management the paper became one of the leader republican newspapers of the country, equally prosperous and influential. In 1880, Mr. Warren was delegate-at-large to the national republican convention. In 18885, he was a prominent candidate for governor, receiving 138 votes in the convention. He came near being chosen United States senator in place of Hon. W. M. Evarts. In October last Mr. Warren went to New York, and had an affecting interview with the late ex-President Arthur. When taking his leave of him Mr. Warren could not restrain his feelings, realizing that it would be the last time he would ever see him on earth. Arthur took his hand in both of his, exclaiming, with deep emotion: "Warren, I love you, and always have." 

Mr. Warren was twice married, his first wife having been Miss Laura, daughter of the late Geo. Love, by whom he had one son, Orsamus G. After her death, he married Miss Mary, daughter of the late Judge Mills, who, together with a son, Wm. C. and a daughter, Mrs. Isaac Bromley, Jr., survive.

Mr. Warren was prominent in many enterprises, and was popular with his friends, his employes and the public. His political opponents respected him. Scrupulously honest, genial and warm-hearted, Buffalo will deeply mourn his loss.

The funeral will take place from the family residence, 222 North street, to-morrow afternoon at 2.30 o'clock. The burial will be at the convenience of the family.

ACTION OF THE BUFFALO PRESS

A special meeting of the Press club to take action on the death of Mr. James D. Warren, was held at the rooms of the club, over the Bank of Buffalo, last evening. There was a large attendance of members, as well as other representatives of the Buffalo press. Among those present were Hon. F. F. Fargo, Rev. Patrick Cronin, Matthias Rohr, N. E. Mack, Richmond C. Hill, Wm. McIntosh, J. Ambrose Butler, Leslie Thom, Arthur W. Austin, J. D. Kellos, E. L. Lawrence, Monte Cutler, Eugene Z. Fleury, George Ferris and others.

President McIntosh feelingly alluded to the object of the meeting, and on motion Rev. Father Cronin was called to preside.

Father Cronin spoke of Mr. Warren as on of Buffalo's foremost citizens. On such occasions as the present, he said, the tongue is very weak to speak what the heart so strongly feels. He was very profoundly impressed by Mr. Warren's death, and had hoped for many weeks for his recover. He compared him to a towering oak struck down by a bolt of lightning, and spoke of his energy, influence and enterprise. He often though and regarded him as a typical American—a man of simple tastes, strong convictions, a strong friend and an honorable foe. Like all our great men, he had the good fortune not to have been born to enervating fortune. He carved his own way by honorable means. He had no offensive mannerisms that repelled those lowlier than himself. He relations with the deceased were always of the most precious character.

Hon. Francis F. Fargo said Mr. Warren was no ordinary man. We do ourselves honor in seeking to honor him. Although Mr. Warren was not a journalist in the strictest sense, he was of publicist of the largest experience. He occupied a position in the front rank of journalists in this country and was known throughout the state and nation. His death is a public calamity. To be thus stricken down in his prime, is a terrible loss. His place will not be easily filled in Buffalo. Mr. Faro moved the appointment of a committee of five to draft resolutions, and Messrs. Fargo, McIntoch, Fleury, Mack and Rohr were appointed.

Mr. R. C. Hill said his experience with Mr. Warren had been most pleasant. He felt that he had lost a friend–one whom he had greatly respected. He thought the entire press, outside of the club, felt his loss was a great one to the profession and to the public. Mr. Warren exerted a peculiar and beneficial influence.

The committee reported the following memorial, which was unanimously adopted:

The death of James D. Warren, in the fullness and vigor of manhood, is an incalculable loss to the city, the state and the nation. His influence and usefulness were not limited to municipal locality, but were felt throughout the commonwealth, even extending to the boundaries of the union itself.

Cast in a large mould Mr. Warren instinctively took a broad and comprehensive view of affairs and was readily recognized by his fellows as a leader of men. He was proverbially modest, never preferring or urging his own claims or merits, but rather promoting those of others of the less meritorious than his own. 

Mr. Warren was a manly man, always dignified and courteous, never trifling, or demeaning himself, and therefore commanded the respect of all classes of men. In society, business, and political affairs he occupied a place in the front rank and the place was not only occupied, but filled. His knowledge of men and affairs seemed intuitive. His judgment as unerring as is possible for human opinion to be, and his integrity was without a blemish. His private life was without reproach, and his death is an almost unbearable bereavement to his afflicted family.

The Press club, speaking for itself and the press generally, feels it an honor to place this brief testimonial upon the bier of one who has added lustre to the profession of which it is a representative.

*Resolved,* That the members of this club will attend the obsequies of Mr. Warren in a body, and invite members of the press generally to join them. 

*Resolved,* That an engrossed copy of the foregoing, attested by the officers of the club, be presented to the family of the deceased.

A committee of arrangements was appointed, and the members of the press will meet at the Press club rooms at 1 P. M. to-morrow, and proceed in a body to the funeral. The meeting then adjourned. 

The directors of White’s bank, of which Mr. Warren was president, the republican executive committee, and the employes of the *Commercial,* passed appropriate resolutions yesterday.
