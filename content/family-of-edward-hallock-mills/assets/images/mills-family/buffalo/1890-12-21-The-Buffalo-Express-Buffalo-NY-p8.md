THE LATE ROBERT MILLS. 

An Admirable Man who was Always Successful.

Very few old Buffalonians will be unable to recognize the strong face in our it to-day of the late Robert Mills, who died on December 11th. He was a self-made man. A cabinboy on the lakes at the age of twelve years, captain of a vessel at the age of 21, and owner of a vessel a few years later, he rose steadily and rapidly because of honesty, and ability and perseverance. In 1855, at the age of 31, Mr. Mills left the sailor's life and established a dry dock. That was the beginning of the large interests centered to-day about the firm of R. Mills & Co.

Mr. Mills's integrity counted in political life as it had in business life. He was an earnest and unwavering Republican. His first appearance in politics was his election to the Common Council from a strong Democratic ward. From 1868 till 1874 he was chairman of the Republican County Committee. In 1871 and '72 he was canal collector of this port. In 1880 he was appointed Police Commissioner by Mayor Brush. His public service was an honor to him and to the city.
