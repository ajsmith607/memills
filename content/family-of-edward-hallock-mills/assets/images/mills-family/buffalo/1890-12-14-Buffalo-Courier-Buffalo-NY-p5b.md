Funeral of the Late Robert Mills 

The funeral services cf the late Capt. Robert Mills were conducted by the Rev. John McLachlan at the family residence on Prospect Avenue yesterday afternoon. The attendance was quite numerous, it including a large delegation from the Excelsior Marine Benevolent Association, and many men connected with the shipbuilding and lake-carrying interests. The floral tributes were beautiful and appropriate, that from the masters' association being prominent. The honorable and useful career of the departed afforded the minister ample material for truthful eulogy, and for pointing a moral.  The interment was at the convenience of the family.
