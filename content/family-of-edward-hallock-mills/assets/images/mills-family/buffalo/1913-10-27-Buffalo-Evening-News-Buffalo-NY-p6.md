HAMLIN'S IS NEW STORE IN BUFFALO TODAY 

New in Name Only, It Stands on Site of the Hamlin and Mendsen of War Times, Then as Now a Leader. 

Today there appears in the advertising columns of the NEWS a new name—Hamlin's, a name that 1s new to the present generation of NEWS readers, when connected with retailing, but one that is by no means new to the elder ones, who will at once associate it and the location of the store with the establishment of Hamlin & Mendsen. 

The store of Hamlin & Mendsen, founded in the spring of 1861 by the late Cicero J. Hamlin, grandfather of Chauncey J. Hamlin, the president of Hamlin’s of today, played an important part in the spirit of patriotism displayed in Buffalo during the Civil War. 

The employes of Hamlin & Mendsen were wild with war fever. At the beginning of the war every night after the close of business about 80 men and boys drilled with broomsticks for guns on the floor of the carpet department in the store that occupied the site of the present Hamlin’s. 

First to Employ Women. 

After several weeks of constant drilling the employes of the store formed themselves into a home guard militia company and they later held regular drills in the old Broadway arsenal, where they were equipped with guns and uniforms. 

On the Fourth of July this company paraded Main street and in the fall 50 or more of the members of the company enlisted for the war in one of the companies of the regiments that were formed in Buffalo to go to the front. The buyer of the lace department of the old Hamlin & Mendsen store, Captain Bailey, headed the company that was composed so largely of employes of the store. 

The late C. J. Hamlin told those men who enlisted for service that if they went to war he would employ their wives, sisters and daughters in his store; thus Mr. Hamlin was the first drygoods merchant in Buffalo, if not the first in the country to employ women as clerks. 

Always in Front. 

At the Hamlin store of war times was the first to employ women, Hamlin's of today has been the first store in Buffalo, as well as one of the first in the United States, to establish an eight-hour selling day and it offers splendid working conditions for all employes. 

In the display advertisement of Hamlin’s in today’s NEWS the store that succeeds The Sweeney Company with a remodeled establishment and complete assortments of new goods, bids for the patronage of the residents of Buffalo and Western New York on the basis of merchandise and service. The assurance is given that the staple lines of wanted goods will be shown in comprehensive assortments in styles, sizes, colors. There is much of interest to take NEWS readers to Hamlin's tomorrow.
