J. H. MILLS DEAD. 

Real Estate Man Stricken by Apoplexy In His Office---Had Been a Resident of Buffalo Many Years. 

(From Yesterday's Last Edition.) 

James H, Hills, a real estate dealer living at 370 Bryant street, fell dead in his office at 446 Main street, over John Kraus & Son's store, this morning at 11 o'clock. He reached his office at 9 o'clock, apparently in good health, and after sorting his morning mail went out. He returned two hours later and stood near his desk chatting with Thomas Fitzgerald, the local agent for the Agricultural Insurance Company, and, without warning, fell heavily forward on the floor. 

Mr. Fitzgerald ran to assist him to his feet and found he was unconscious and, to all appearances, dying. He telephoned for Dr. C. R. Jewett, whose office is in the Y. M. C. A., but Mr. Mills expired before the physician left his office. 

Dr. Jewett said death resulted from apoplexy. 

Mr. Mills was 68 years old, He was born in the village of Clarence, and came to Buffalo when a young man. He found employment with Adam, Meldrum & Anderson, and remained with that firm for 20 years. He resigned his position 10 years ago to embark in the real estate business. 

Mr. Mills made his home with his sister, Mrs. Martha Baker, at 370 Bryant street. His brother, John, who is over 70 years of age, has also lived there for a number of years. 

The deceased was a brother of Mrs. James D. Warren, widow of the late editor of the Buffalo Commercial. 

The funeral will be held Wednesday afternoon at 2 o'clock at 870 Bryant street. The interment will be made at Clarence.
