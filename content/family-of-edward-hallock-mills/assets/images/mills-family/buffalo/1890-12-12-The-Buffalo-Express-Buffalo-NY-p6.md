OBITUARY.  

DEATH OF ROBERT MILLS 

The many friends and acquaintances of Robert Mills were pained, though not surprised, to hear yesterday that he was dead. His demise occurred early yesterday morning, after suffering for several days from apoplexy. Mr. Mills had been an invalid for several years, from a stroke of paralysis.

Robert Mills was born in Toronto, Ont., on November 17, 1824, his parents coming from Belfast, Ireland, a year before. His early schooling was very limited, as his parents were poor and required his assistance to aid in the support of the family. At the age of twelve years Robert came to Buffalo, and at once shipped as cabin-boy on the schooner John E. Hunt, which plied between this city and Chicago, and from that day to the day of his death his life had been closely associated with the marine interests of Buffalo.

From his humble position as cabin-boy Mr. Mills gradually rose to the deck, and, after, filling every subordinate position on ship, was at the age of 21 years made captain of the brig Uncle Sam, having a capacity of 35,000 bushels. He was the youngest vessel-master on the lakes—a fact to which in late years Mr. Mills always referred with considerable pride. When he left the brig Uncle Sam he was placed in command of the schooner Philadelphia with a capacity of 5,000 bushels, and of this ship he was half owner. This was the first vessel in which Mr. Mills had a proprietary interest. He was after then master of the schooner George Davis, the brig Hampton, the schooner Hope, which he owned exclusively; also the schooner P, P. Pratt, and the Kate L. Bruce. 

In 1855 Mr. Mills, after 19 years of sailing life, left active service, and established a floating dry-dock in this port with Patrick Walsh, under the firm name of Mills & Walsh, and in 1866 the firm bought the ship-yard and dry-dock of F. N. Jones and engaged in repairing and building lake craft. At the same time the firm was increased by J. Rice. and was known as R. Mills & Co. In 1875 Mr. Mills’s partner. Patrick Walsh, died, but his heirs retained the interest in the firm, and the firm name has remained unchanged to this day.

In his political life Mr. Mills was an ardent and earnest Republican. Positive in his opinions, on political questions, he never lacked the courage of his convictions, and because he believed in Republican principles he never wavered in his devotion to the interests of his party. His first appearance in public life was in 1860, when he was elected alderman from the Eighth Ward, carrying one of the strongest Democratic Wards of the city. He was reelected in 1861 and was defeated in 1863 by just eleven votes. While alderman. Mr. Mills was appointed by President Lincoln, in 1861. as steamboat inspector for this district and he held this office until 1865. In 1868 he was chairman of the Republican County Committee and continued so until 1874. In 1871 and 1872 he was Canal Collector at this port and discharged the duties of this office as he did all others, with honor and credit to himself. In 1880, upon the reorganization of the Police Department, he was appointed Police Commissioner by Mayor Brush, and he served in this capacity with great earnestness.

Mr. Mills’s domestic life was happy. In 1845 he married Margarette A. Cherry of Chautauqua County, and three children—two sons and one daughter—resulted from this union, all of whom survive him. In early life Mr. Mills adopted the Presbyterian faith and was a member and regular attendant of Lafayette street Presbyterian Church. He was a member of Hiram Lodge. Buffalo Chapter, and Hugh De Payen Commandery.

The funeral will take place from the family home, No. 286 Prospect Avenue, on Saturday at three o'clock.
