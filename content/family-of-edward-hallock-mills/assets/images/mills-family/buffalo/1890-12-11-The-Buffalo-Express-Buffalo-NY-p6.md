Serious Illness of Robert Mills. 

The many friends of Mr. Robert Mills, senior member of the dry-dock firm of R. Mills & Co,, will regret to learn that he was stricken with apoplexy at his home, No. 286 Prospect Avenue, on Monday afternoon, and is now lying at the point of death, his physicians holding out but slight hopes for his recovery. Mr. Mills has been unconscious since he was first stricken and has grown gradually more feeble since, and late last night it was stated that the end might be looked for at any moment.
