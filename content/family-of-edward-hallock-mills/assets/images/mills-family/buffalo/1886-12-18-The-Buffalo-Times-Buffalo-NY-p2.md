JAMES D. WARREN. 

Again our voices are hushed in the presence of that dread visitor death. This time he has claimed for his victim one of our leading and most influential citizens, a man of sterling worth. His loss will not only be felt within the confines of our city, but throughout the broad extent of our whole state. James D. Warren passed from this life last evening at a little after nine o’clock. His taking off will be deeply and sincerely regretted by the whole community. He was born in the town of Bennington, Wyoming Co., N. Y., on the 19th day of January, 1823. His early life was spent on the farm and in the country store owned by his father, the late Orsamus Warren, one of the pioneers of Western New York. Just before attaining his majority he visited the southern states and was a resident of Natchez, Miss., for about a year. He was a supervisor from the town of Clarence, where the family had lived since he was two years of age, for a number of terms. In 1854 he was elected county treasurer, serving a term of three years. He subsequently served as clerk to the board of supervisors for a number of terms, and in April of 1861 he entered upon his life work of publisher by purchasing in connection with Joseph Candee, the Buffalo Commercial Advertiser. Later, in 1862, Mr. Candee gave place in the firm to Mr. Wheeler who two years later retired in favor of James N. Matthews. In 1877 Mr. Warren became by purchase the sole owner of the paper and remained so until the time of his death. He has always been an earnest and active Republican, never turning aside from his party or from that he considered fidelity to its principles. Although he has never been an office-holder other than we have stated his counsels have always been listened to and of late years he has been one of the most striking figures in the party both in state and national affairs. He has served repeatedly as a member of the state committee and as chairman thereof, has been delegate to both state and national nominating conventions. He was recognized as the leader of the straight out or “stalwart” element in his party and had no patience with those who yielded up party allegiance to personal preference. He was a great and close observer, a thorough student of human nature and a finished manipulator of men. Had he lived there is no question but that he would have been the next standard bearer of his party in the contest for the governor’s chair and for the supremacy of the party in the state. 

So passes away a man who only a few short weeks ago was up and down our streets, the embodiment of health, strength and manly vigor. THE TIMES unites with the whole people and with the press in offering condolences and sincere sympathy to the afflicted family in this, the hour of their deep bereavement.
