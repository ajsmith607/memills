Charter Revision. 

A SCHOOL BOARD OF SIXTEEN PROVIDED FOR BY THE PROPOSED CHAPTERâ€”THE MAIN PROVISIONS. 

The Department of Education. 

The General Committee on Charter Revision met at the Mayor's office at 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon. The attendance was quite general, although only one full report, that on the School Department, was handed in. Chairman Spencer Clinton and Secretary S. A. Simons occupied their respective posts.  

Mr. Fullerton offered appropriate resolutions on the death of Mr. James D. Warren, which were adopted, the chair making some very just remarks as to the worth of Mr. Warren as a citizen and the loss the community had sustained in his death.
