THE END HAS COME! 

DEATH OF ORSAMUS G. WARREN. 

He Passed Away Peacefully at 9.15 This Morning—A Biographical Sketch— His Political and Business Career. 

This is a terribly sad day for the BUFFALO COMMERCIAL, and all its employees and friends. 

Orsamus G. Warren, the honored and beloved head of the establishment, died at his residence on North street at 9.15 this morning, after a very brief illness, at the age of 45 years. He was cut down in the very prime of his life, and just at the time when his usefulness seemed greatest. It is, indeed, an inscrutable dispensation of Providence. 

It only remains to tell in brief, the story of his last illness, and give a few prominent facts regarding his life. 

Mr. Warren had been very active in his business affairs throughout the winter and spring, but his health continued good, and he seemed in fact, to be more than usually vigorous. 

He went to New York last month to attend the annual meeting of the State Associated Press, of which be was President, and which was held April 19th and 20th. He remained in the Metropolis for a week later, and returned home to Buffalo on Wednesday morning, April 27th. That same night he left for Albany to attend the Republican State Convention, which was held there Thursday, April 28th. 

He returned home on Friday morning, and it is thought, caught the fatal cold on the sleeping car. He attended to business part of the day on Friday last—only one week ago—and in the afternoon complained of feeling chilly and remained at home. The following day he was also unable to leave the house, though nothing serious was apprehended. He put himself under the care of Dr. Stockton, the family physician. His condition grew worse, however, and Wednesday morning the case was diagnosed as lobar pneumonia. Drs. Cary and Rochester were called in consultation, and the three physicians have since been unremitting, trying everything that their skill and experience could suggest, but all to no purpose. As the COMMERCIAL stated yesterday, the case was looked upon with grave anxiety. The patient was unconscious most of the time. As yesterday wore on it became evident that the chances for recovery were not so good, but a slight rally in the evening gave some encouragement. The fatal change, however, came about 3 o’clock this morning, since which time he sank rapidly, and passed away at 9.15, calmly and peacefully, surrounded by his beloved family and most devoted friends.
