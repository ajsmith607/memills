The Late Robert Mills. 

In the obituary notice of the late Robert Mills, published yesterday, it was stated that he was the son of Scotch parents. This was a mistake, inasmuch as his father and mother were from Belfast, Ireland. 

The funeral of Mr. Mills takes place tomorrow afternoon at 3 oâ€™clock.
