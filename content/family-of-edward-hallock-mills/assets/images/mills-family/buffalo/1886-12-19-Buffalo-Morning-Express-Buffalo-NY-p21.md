James D. Warren. 

ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE FUNERAL—ACTION OF THE BUFFALO REPUBLICAN LEAGUE, THE PRESS, AND OTHER BODIES.  

Various Expressions of Sorrow. 

At the autopsy held over the body of the late James D. Warren at 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon there were present Drs. Burwell, Park, Hill, Davidson, Thomas F. Rochester, Folwell, Putname, and DeLancey Rochester. The examination showed that the cause of Mr. Warren's sickness and death was the formation of a large abscess back of the left kidney, containing a quart or more of matter, which had burrowed its way down in search of an outlet to the left groin, where it came to a point, and in order to facilitate this discharge Dr. Park made an opening into it. The abscess, it was found, would inevitably have resulted in death. Otherwise all the organs were in a condition not incompatible with the return of health, and a number of minor complications would have been readily subject to cure.

The family has received a great many letters of condolence from nearly all the prominent men of the party throughout the State and from Washington.

The funeral will take place from the family residence, No. 222 North Street, on Monday at 2.30 P.M., the burial to be at the convenience of the family. The body is to rest temporarily in a vault at Forest Lawn. It has not yet been decided whether he will be interred at Clarence, his old home.

**Formal Expressions of Sorrow.** 

Meetings were held by a number of organizations yesterday and their grief at the death of James D. Warren was formally expressed. The special meeting of the Buffalo Republican League last evening was largely attended. President Ogden P. Letchworth, in stating the sad duty for the League had met, fittingly referred to the great loss which City and State have suffered. He called upon, as better qualified to speak of the work and worth of Mr. Warren, Mr. S. C. Adams, an honorary member of the organization, and for many yours a bosom friend of Mr. Warren. Mr. Adams was visibly affected, and as he spoke was so deeply moved that his voice was controlled with difficulty. His acquaintance with Mr. Warren dated from 1852, when the latter represented Clarence in the Board of Supervisors, and he himself represented Collins. He had learned to love him as a brother. 

Messr. Seward A. Simonds, Emory P. Close, and William L. Marcy were appointed a committee to draft a suitable memorial, which as read by Mr. Simons as follows:

The Republican League has learned with deep sorrow of the death of James D. Warren, and unites in the genuine sentiment of public bereavement which is universal in this community.

Mr. Warren drew to himself with rare attractiveness a host of loyal friends, because he himself never betrayed one whose friendship he enjoyed. His name was a synonym of financial integrity, business worth, and untiring energy. His political life was one of conscientious fidelity and consistent devotion to a great party in whose principles he believed, the confidence of whose honored leaders he merited and received. His unswerving loyalty was marked by no personal ambition, his service was freely bestowed with no thought of recompense in position or power. His integrity of purpose never recognized a selfish end, he was a worthy leader, a trusted friend, a broad and liberal man, and a pure-minded citizen. 

As a mark of respect to his memory, it is appropriate that the rooms of the League be draped in mourning for 30 days. 

Mr. Simons moved the adoption of the resolution, Mr. Close in seconding the motion said: 

In the funeral hush and shadow of Mr. Warren's death it is difficult to fitly speak. We are met here to pay honor and homage to the memory of a pure man, a distinguished citizen, and a brave leader, To me the announcement comes with the oppressive weight of a deep personal loss. It was my privilege to know Mr. Warren intimately. During the Presidential campaign of 1884, when Mr. Warren was chairman of the State Committee, at his request, I accompanied him to New-York, and remained during the last two months of that active campaign, and had many opportunities of appreciating his administrative skill, able leadership, and unfaltering zeal. Strength, candor, and loyalty were the leading characteristics of his nature. His strength was shown in a firmness of purpose and conviction which could brook no opposition; in an energy and enterprise which commanded and achieved success. His candor was exhibited by his open and ingenious utterances. His friends could always rely upon the assurances of his aid ; his foes were promptly advised of an opposition which gave and asked no quarter. With him, the promise to the ear was never broken to the hope; his speech was ever the transparent vesture of his thought. His loyalty was demonstrated by an adherence to principle and to friend which never wavered, never doubted, never failed. 

Mr. Warren was the truly valiant man, who dared nothing but what he should; who feared nothing but what he ought. Noble in life, he is splendid in ashes, and will be eminent in the grave. He has gone from us forever, Nothing remains for us but to indulge ourselves in that sweet anxiety which arises from the memory of a great affliction. He at last has joined the everlasting majority. He leaves behind him the recollection of 

Only those actions of the just 

Which smell sweet and blossom in the dust. 

Mr. N.S. Rosenau, in briefly paying his tribute of respect to Mr. Warren's memory, dwelt especially upon the great modesty of the man, who, while a leader, was contented and glad to remain in the ranks. He had made it his ambition to make famous the names and careers of other men. It was but fitting that the League should endeavor to keep green the memory of him who sought no honor for himself. 

Mr. John Laughlin spoke with eloquent feeling. Mr. Warren had often befriended and wisely counseled him. When the speaker came to Buffalo Mr. Warren was the on!y man he knew here, having previously met him at Washington. One quality specially worthy of mention, he said, was the fact that Mr. Warren's strongest friendships were among men younger than himself. The pleasantest part of his life had been spent with young men. He wanted to be one of the "boys" and be with the boys. As young Republicans, the League mourned his untimely death, because in him they had a friend, a true and trusted leader. Those who knew him best mourned his loss as a man whose friendship could never be replaced. 

The memorial was unanimously adopted and on motion the House Committee was instructed to drape the rooms of the League in mourning for 30 days. 

Upon motion a committer of active and honorary members, of which President Letchworth is chairman, was appointed to represent the League at the funeral of the deceased. All members of the League are invited to join the committee at the rooms of the League at 1.30 o'clock to-morrow afternoon. With the chairman, the members of the committee are: Messrs. S. Cary Adams, Philo D. Beard, N. C, Barnum, Philip Becker, Alexander Brush, Emory P. Close, F. S. Crego, Frank S. Coit, James Crate, F. L, Danforth, W. C. Francis, F. C. Ferguson, John C. Graves, James F. Gluck, W. H. Gratwick, Samuel Higgins. R. R. Hefford, C. O. Howard, W, S, Jenkins, Josiah Jewett, Spencer Kellogg. John Laughlin, Thomas Loomis, William L. Marcy, Frank T. Moulton, Daniel H. McMillan, J. J. McWilliams, John Otto, Jr., Charles A. Pooley, A. E. Perrine, Pascal P. Pratt, H. T. Ramsdeil, N. S. Rosenau, A. J. Rich, P. A. Rosseel, D. L. Ransom, S. S. Rogers, B. C. Rumsey, S. A. Simons, L. H. Smith, W. J. Strong,  Henry E. Smith, C. G. Shepard, J. E. Thomas, H. S. Thayer, George Urban, Jr., George Wardwell, W. H. Walker, M. T. Warren, John L. Williams, R. P. Wilson. A. P. Wright, A. J. Wright, H. P. Clark, William H. Watts, G. R. Wilson, A. A. Woltge, C. R. Wheeler,  F. F. Williams, H. P. Whitaker, O. P. Letchworth, O. L. Laycock, J. G. Haffa, J. M. Provoost. 

ACTION OF THE NEWSPAPER MEN. 

A meeting of the Press Club and representatives of the press of Buffalo was held at the rooms of that organization last evening to take action on the death of Mr. Warren. President Mclntosh called the meeting to order, briefly stating its purpose and saying that it seemed proper though Mr. Warren had not been a member of the club, that the body take some action on his decease.

On motion of Mr. George Ferris, the Rev. Father Cronin was called to the chair, and on taking the seat he said that he should accuse himself of culpable neglect if he excused himself from attendance at the meeting upon the invitation he had received. It seemed at this time that the tongue was very weak to utter what the heart felt. Doubtless all were pained, as he was, to learn of Mr. Warren's death. Meditating upon it, it seemed as if some towering forest oak had been stricken with lightning from a summer sky, for he towered aloft not alone because of magnificent physique, but because of his indomitable energy and his wide, far-extending influence. He had often thought since he had become acquainted with Mr. Warren that he was a typical American in that he was a man of simple tastes and strong convictions which he had the courage to proclaim. He was a strong friend and an honorable foe. Like all great men he had the good fortune not to be born to enervating fortune. There was in him no lordly, offensive manner to repel those in the lower walks of life. He regarded himself as the peer of any man, but with his inferiors his relations were the pleasantest. In conclusion Father Cronin said he wished he could join those present in piercing the gloom that darkened the pleasure of his family in these merry days of Christmastide and assist in weaving a wreath of immortelles for our late departed journalistic friend, James D. Warren.

Mr. F. F. Fargo said he, too, regretted his loss. Mr. Warren was no ordinary man. The club did itself honor in seeking to do him honor. Though not a journalist, strictly speaking, he had been connected with journalism most of his life, and had occupied an enviable position in the front rank. His influence was not circumscribed by Buffalo, but was known throughout the State and country. To be thus stricken down in his prime was a terrible loss. He thought it fitting that the club should place on record some suitable memorial, and moved that a committee of five be appointed to express the sentiment of the meeting.

The chair appointed as such Messrs. F. F. Fargo, William McIntosh, Norman E. Mack, Matthias Rohr, and Arthur W. Austin.

While the committee was making its report, Mr. R. C. Hill took occasion to add a few words, saying that his experiences with and reminiscences of Mr. Warren were most satisfactory. He deplored the loss of one so respected, and one who so ably represented the journalistic profession in Buffalo. He hoped a general expression of the entire press, irrespective of club membership, would be obtained, as he was sure the whole press united in regretting the loss of this respected member. 

Mr. Ambrose Butler took occasion to say that he was not personally related to Mr. Warren, but his brother had known him well. He had just received a telegram from Mr. E. H. Butler saying that he deeply regretted the death of his brother journalist, and united in paying a tribute to his memory, 

Chairman Fargo then reported the following resolutions, which were unanimously adopted as the sentiment of the meeting:

The death of James D. Warren in the fullness and vigor of manhood is an incalculable loss to the City, the State, and the Nation. His influence and usefulness were not limited to municipal locality, but were felt throughout the Commonwealth, even extending to the boundaries of the Union itself.

Cast in a large mold, Mr. Warren instinctively took a broad and comprehensive view of affairs, and was readily recognized by his fellows as a leader of men. He was proverbially modest, never preferring nor urging his own claims or merits, but rather promoting those of others often less meritorious than his own.

Mr. Warren was a manly man. Always dignified and courteous, never trifling nor demeaning himself, he therefore commanded the respect of all classes of men. In society, business, and political affairs he occupied a place in the front rank and the place was not only occupied but filled. His knowledge of men and affairs seemed intuitive, his judgement as unerring as is possible for human opinions to be, and his integrity was without reproach and his death is an almost unbearable bereavement to his afflicted family.

The Press Club, speaking for itself and the press of the City of Buffalo, feel it an honor to place this brief testimonial upon the bier of one who has added luster to the profession of which it is a representative.

*Resolved,* That the members of the club will attend the obsequies of Mr. Warren in a body, and invite members of the press generally to join them.

*Resolved,* That an engrossed copy of the foregoing, attested by the officers of the club, be presented to the family of the deceased.

The resolutions as first read were indicative only of regret on the part of the Press Club, but on motion of Mr. R. C. Hill the words "and the press of the City of Buffalo" were interpolated and they were thus adopted.

Mr. Leslie Thorn paid a tribute to the memory of Mr. Warren in a few eloquent sentences saying that he deeply regretted the loss of a man whom he had known personally and who had made a deep and abiding impression upon the affairs of the city, while at the same time he took a melancholy pleasure in thus giving utterance to his regard for the deceased.

Mr. Matthias Rohr gave voice to sentiments of respect concerning the loss to the community of a man who was so great a figure in it, and whom he had known so well.

Mr. Arthur W. Austin said that in the editorial of the *Commercial* would be found the universal sentiments of its employees. He could only add emphasis to its sad truth. He felt deeply the loss of a kind, true, and steadfast friend, as did all his co-laborers.

Mr. Fargo moved that as the resolutions provided that the press should attend in a body, that a committee of arrangements be appointed by the chair to provide for this, and the following committee was named: Messrs. F. F. Fargo, George Bleistein, George M. Hausauer, E. H. Butler, Eugene Fleury, and Norman E. Mack.

The meeting then adjourned.

ACTION OF THE REPUBLICAN COUNTY EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

The Republican County Executive Committee at a regular meeting yesterday morning adopted the following:

It is with feeling of pained surprise and regret that we learn that James D. Warren is dead.

The leader of the Republican party in Western New-York has passed away, leaving a vacancy in our ranks not soon or easily to be filled. His was the saving common sense on which so often the party has leaned for support; his was the prudent conservatism which demanded time to wisely investigate and carefully act. His was the unswerving fidelity to friend which stood unshaken through good and evil reports and which, though often tried, never failed in the hour of need.

His name will live in the history of the Republican party associated with those for whom he toiled and who honored him for his real worth—the genial, whole-souled gentleman, Chester A. Arthur, the noble-minded, upright Judge, Charles J. Folger.

Let others tell of his sterling business ability, of his untiring industry and indefatigable perseverance which have placed the moneyless lad among the merchant princes of our city. To us his death comes with a sense of personal bereavement. We shall miss his noble presence, his unfailing courage, his manly hope. We shall miss his words of wise counsel, his knowledge of men and affairs. We are sensible that in the structure of Republicanism a great pillar has fallen, and contemplating the space it has left, we realize that the loss exceeds any mere private grief and becomes a public calamity. On the shaft which may honor his memory might well be written the two words which best describe his character, “Firm and True.” We do not venture to intrude into the private grief of his family circle. In a tribute of deep sympathy in this hour of affliction we respectfully unit with all citizens of the city which he loved so much and which honored and respected him.

In honor of his memory our rooms shall be draped in mourning for the space of 30 days.

ACTION OF WHITE’S BANK DIRECTORS

White’s Bank was draped in mourning yesterday and the chair which the departed president, Mr. James D. Warren, was wont to occupy, bore the somber emblem of death. At 3.30 P. M. the directors held a special meeting and unanimously adopted the following resolutions presented by Mr. Nelson K. Hopkins: 

We have heard with profound regret and sorrow of the death of the Hon. James D. Warren, the president of this bank, with whom we have been pleasantly associated for many years. He was an able and accomplished man of business, a warm and devoted friend, and an agreeable companion. He has been called to many important and responsible positions in life and he has filled them all with honor and credit.

*Resolved*, That in the death of Mr. Warren this bank has lost a wise, honest and indefatigable officer, who has always had its success and prosperity at heart; that we individually have lost a valued friend, the bank a safe counselor, and this community a highly esteemed and worthy citizen.

*Resolved*, That we extend to the family of the deceased our sympathy in its bereavement; that  out of respect to his memory, this bank be draped in mourning for 30 days, and that this board attend the funeral in a body.

*Resolved*, That these resolutions be entered in the minutes, and a copy be sent to the family of the deceased, and published in the daily papers of the city.

In reporting Gen. R. L. Howard’s remarks about Mr. Warren an indefinite expression was used, leading possibly to the inference that there was some thought of winding up White’s Bank on account of his death. This would certainly be a forced construction of the language, which was intended to convey the idea that the bank could not be closed, even temporarily, for the death or funeral of its lamented President.

ACTION OF THE DECEASED’S EMPLOYEES.

The compositors of the *Commercial* newsroom held a meeting yesterday noon to take action on Mr. Warren’s death. Mr. N. W. Thayer, the foreman, was called to the chair, and Mr. Anthony W. Landsittel was chosen secretary. Messrs. Ferdinand [unclear], George R. Hilbert, Don Wight, Herman Metke, and Judson A. Taylor, appointed a committee to draft a suitable memorial, presented the following which was adopted unanimously:

We, the compositors and employees of the *Buffalo Commercial Advertiser’s* newsroom, wish to put on record some expression of the sorrow with which the death of James D. Warren, our late employer and friend, has filled us.

Mr. Warren has been to all of us, as an employer as fair and just as man could be. He never made a promise that he did not fulfill to the letter. He never encouraged hopes that be had reason to believe could not be realized. What he said to us we knew he meant; we knew that it could be depended upon.  

Many of us have gone to Mr. Warren in times of trouble for counsel or for assistance. It is a pleasure, as well as a duty, to say at this time that we never failed to get good advice, real sympathy, and judicious aid. Our employer was always our kindly well-wisher and true friend. We mourn his too-early death sincerely, and beg his sorrowing family to accept our sympathy and this memorial as a proof of our real affection for Mr. Warren, and our regard for those he loved best.

The employees of the *Commercial’s* job department held a meeting at 1 P. M. Mr. F. P. Turner presided. The following memorial, presented by a committee consisting of Messrs. Jacob Pfohl, Alfred Paddon, and C. J. Wolfe, was adopted:

We, the employees of the *Commercial Advertiser* job printing department, feel deeply grieved at the untimely death of our honored friend and employer, Mr. James D. Warren. We bear testimony to the fact that he was always kind and considerate in his treatment of us, and we, one and all, had reason to regard him as a kind, just, and consistent friend.

As an employer he had our fullest respect. We admired his many noble qualities and the justness of his dealings. To his family we offer our deepest sympathy at this the time of their great loss, and assure them that we too are mourners.

Mr. Warren's sterling qualities of heart and mind are too well known to the community at large to need extended eulogy at our hands, but it is at such a time as this that we can best appreciate his great worth and feel the deep loss that has fallen upon us. 

He was fair and honorable to all. We deeply deplore his loss, and sincerely regret that death has severed the pleasant relations always sustained between him and those who entered his service. 

ACTION OF FIFTH WARD REPUBLICANS.

At a meeting of the Fifth Ward Republican Committee last evening the following resolution was adopted:

The Fifth Ward Republican Committee desire to add expressions commemorative of the esteem and regard with which we have at all times looked upon James D. Warren. As a leading Republican in Wester New-York and especially in Erie County his counsel and advice, it has seemed to us, were such that they could be relied upon as being safe, prudent, and politic, and it was always with feelings of assurance and success that his wise counsel and advice were received. Truly the Republican party in the County of Erie has lost an able and staunch leader in the person of Mr. Warren. His private life, genial, whole-souled disposition are known to all who knew him, and those where were privileged to know him intimately can best testify to his honorable manhood and his deep anxiety for the success of his friends or anyone in whom he became interested, and to the value of his wisdom and counsel. We extremely regret his untimely death and our sympathy is with those who knew him better and those who loved him best.

**A Meeting of City Hall Officials.**

It was the unanimous opinion of the officials of the City and County Hall, irrespective of party, that a meeting should be held to take action on Mr. Warren’s death. It was decided to hold it at the Mayor’s office to-morrow morning at 11 o’clock.

**Feeling Among Republican Congressmen**

*SPECIAL TO THE BUFFALO EXPRESS*

Washington, Dec. 18.—Major Farquar and Col. J. B. Weber sent telegrams of condolence to the family of Mr. James D. Warren, on learning of that gentleman’s death this morning. Col Weber started to-night for Buffalo, where he expects to arrive at 8.35 o’clock to-morrow evening for the purpose of attending the funeral. Maj Farquar will not go. He has a great many matters of interest to his constituents to look after, with will occupy all his time from now on until after the recess.

**Regret at Lockport.** 

*SPECIAL TO THE BUFFALO EXPRESS*

Lockport, Dec. 18.—The death of James D, Warren of Buffalo when announced here created a general feeling of sadness among the prominent Republicans. General regret that such a party leader should be taken away in his prime is expressed.
