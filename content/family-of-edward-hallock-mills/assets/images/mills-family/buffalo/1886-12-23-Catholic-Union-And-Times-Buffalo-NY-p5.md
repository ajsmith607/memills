JAMES D. WARREN.

Death of one of Buffalo's Most Prominent Citizen's–Universal Expression of Regret—Action of the Press Club.

The news of the death of Mr. Warren last Friday evening created a profound sensation. It is not our intention to give any extended sketch of the distinguished gentleman’s life, or of his prominence as a citizen, politician or business man. That has all been done so eloquently and copiously since the announcement of Mr. Warren’s death, and before it, not only by the press of Buffalo, but of the entire state irrespective of party, that it is unnecessary to do so here. Mr. Warren was best known outside of Buffalo as the proprietor of the *Commercial Advertiser* and a prominent leader of the Republican party. In Buffalo he was known as an upright business man, an ideal employer, and a genial, warm-hearted friend.

The various civic and political bodies, the employes of the different departments of the *Commercial* printing house, and the Press Club met promptly after the announcement of Mr. Warren’s death and took appropriate action. We append herewith the report of the action taken by the Press Club, which we find in Monday’s *Commercial*:

ACTION OF MEMBERS OF THE PRESS.

A largely attended meeting of members of the press was held Saturday evening at the rooms of the Press Club, to take action on the death of Mr. Warren. President Mcintosh called the meeting to order, briefly stating its purpose, and saying that it seemed proper though Mr. Warren had not been a member of that club, that the body take some action on his decease.

On motion of Mr. George Ferris, the Rev. Father Cronin was called to the chair, on assuming which he spoke as follows:

“Gentlemen–I should regard myself guilty of culpable neglect in the performance of a solemn and melancholy duty did I fail to unite with you to-night in paying a suitable tribute to the memory of James D. Warren.

“Alas! that in moments such as these the tongue should be weak to express what the heart so strongly feels. 

“I have been profoundly impressed with the announcement of Mr. Warren’s death.

“Like a towering forest oak stricken by unexpected lightning from a summer sky, so comes the merciless arrow of the inevitable destroyer to one who indeed towered aloft above the crowd, not only by his commanding presence and superb physique, but by his strong personality and far-reaching influence as well.

“Reflecting upon the all too untimely death of Mr. Warren—snatched away in the midst of his vigor, his usefulness, his power and his fame, who can help exclaiming to himself at least: And what is it all when all is done! It seems like the sudden dropping of the curtain and the quenching of the lights ere the play is half over.

“I am aware indeed how utterly vain is spoken praise to “the dull cold ear of death.” But we owe it to the living, we owe it to our city, we owe it to the state, aye, we owe it to the nation to record our estimate of Mr. Warren’s rare worth, ere his remains be consigned to their final rest.  
 
“I shall not dwell now on the varied aspects of his long and useful career. That has been done to-day by the kindly pens of our city press; and the story of the dead journalist’s life will be rehearsed throughout the land.

“He was no child of enervating fortune. Like nearly all our great men, Mr. Warren sprang from the people; and all his manhood years were with the people and for them. And if those years were crowned with signal success—with large wealth and commanding influence–that success was achieved by resourceful brain, tireless labor and high endeavor. I have long regarded Mr. Warren as a typical American, simple in his tastes, strong in his convictions, rigorous in upholding them, he was warm as a friend and honorable as a foe; and while feeling himself the equal of any, he stooped to the lowly with an affability that won their hearts.

“Such is the impression left upon me during my occasional intercourse with the distinguished dead.

“In his demise Buffalo loses one of her foremost citizens, his party a sage in council and a hero in battle, his friends a man of whose regard they had reason to be proud, and the people of whatever condition, one whose sympathy was theirs and upon whose word they could rely.

“I am glad to state that my acquaintance with Mr. Warren was of the pleasantest character; and now that he is gone, I only wish I could pierce the desolation that enshrouds his lately happy home with some ray of sunshine, which joining you gentlemen in weaving for the memory of the illustrious dead a heart-wreath of immortelles.”

F. F. Fargo said he too had felt profoundly the shock of the sudden news which reached him that morning regarding the death of their distinguished friend and fellow citizen. Mr. Warren was no ordinary man, and in honoring him they honored themselves. Although not a journalist in the strictest sense of the word, Mr. Warren was a publicist of large experience and extended knowledge. After spending most of the years of his mature life at newspaper work he had come to occupy a proud position in the front rank, it might be said, among the journalists of the country. His influence and knowledge of men and affairs were not by any means limited to Buffalo. He was known and respected throughout the state and nation, and the death of such a man was a public calamity. Having thus been stricken down in the very prime of his manhood, his place in Buffalo would not be easily filled. The speaker moved the appointment of a committee of five to draft suitable resolution. Carried, and the chair appointed Messrs. F. F. Fargo, Wm. McIntosh, Norman E. Mack, Matthias Rohr, and Arthur W. Austin.

While the committee was making its report, Mr. R. C. Hill took occasion to add a few words, saying that his experiences with and reminiscences of Mr. Warren were most satisfactory. He deplored the loss of one so respected, and one who so ably represented the journalistic profession in Buffalo. He hoped a general expression of the entire press, irrespective of club membership, would be obtained, as he was sure the whole press united in regretting the loss of this respected member. 

Mr. Ambrose Butler took occasion to say that he was not personally acquainted with Mr. Warren, but his brother had known him well. He had just received a telegram from Mr. E. H. Butler saying the he deeply regretted the death of Mr. Warren, and united in paying tribute to his memory.

Chairman Fargo then reported the following resolutions, which were unanimously adopted, as the sentiment of the meeting:

The death of James D. Warren in the fullness of vigor and manhood is an incalculable loss to the city, the state and the nation. His influence and usefulness were not limited to municipal locality, but were felt throughout the commonwealth, even extending to the very boundaries of the Union itself.

Cast in a large mold, Mr. Warren instinctively took a broad and comprehensive view of affairs, and was readily recognized by his fellows as a leader of men. He was proverbially modest, never preferring nor urging his own claims or merits, but rather promoting those of others often less meritorious than his own.

Mr. Warren was a manly man. Always dignified and courteous, never trifling or demeaning himself, he therefore commanded the respect of all classes of men. In society, business and political affairs he occupied a place in the front rank and the place was not only occupied but filled. His knowledge of men and affairs seemed intuitive, his judgment as unerring as is possible for human opinions to be, and his integrity was without a blemish. His private life was without a reproach and his death is an almost unbearable bereavement to his afflicted family.

The Press Club, speaking for itself and the press of the city of Buffalo, feel it an honor to place this brief testimonial upon the bier of one who has added lustre in the profession of which it is a representative.

*Resolved,* That the members of the club will attend the obsequies of Mr. Warren in a body, and invite members of the press generally to join them.

*Resolved,* That an engrossed copy of the foregoing, attested by the officers of the club, be presented to the family of the deceased.

The resolutions as first read were indicative only of regret on the part of the Press Club, but on motion of Mr. R. C. Hill, the words “and the press of the city of Buffalo” were interpolated and they were thus adopted.

Mr. Leslie Thom paid a tribute to the memory of Mr. Warren, saying that he deeply regretted the loss of a man whom he had known personally and who had made a deep and abiding impression on the affairs of the city, while at the same time he took a melancholy pleasure in thus giving utterance to the regard for the deceased.

Mr. Matthias Rohr gave voice to the sentiments of respect concerning the loss to the community of a man who was so great a figure in it, and whom he had known so well.

Arthur W. Austin said the sentiments of the entire staff of the *Commercial Advertiser* had been so well set forth in a brief editorial contained in the paper of that evening, that any further words from him would be superfluous. They all felt they had lost a true, kind, steadfast friend, one who had always been considerate in his treatment of his employes, ever ready to overlook failings and prompt to commend what he deemed commendable.

Mr. Fargo moved that as the resolutions provided that the press should attend in a body, that a committee of arrangements be appointed by the chair to provide for this, and the following committee was named: Messrs. F. F. Fargo, George Bleistein, George M. Hausaffer, E. H. Butler, Eugene Fleury, Norman E. Mack.

The meeting then adjourned.
