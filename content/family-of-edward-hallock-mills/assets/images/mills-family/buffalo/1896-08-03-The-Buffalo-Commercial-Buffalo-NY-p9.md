DROPPED DEAD.

James H. Mills, Well-Known Buffalonian, Expired Without a Moment’s Warning.

APOPLEXY WAS THE CAUSE. 

Mr. Mills Was in His Office on Main Street When the Attack Came—He Made a Joking Remark to a Friend a Moment Before He Fell.  

James H. Mills, well-known real estate dealer, dropped  dead in his office about 11 o’clock this morning. 

He seemed in perfect health up to the moment of his death. He came down to his office at 446 Main street about 9 o’clock. After looking over his mail he went out to attend to some matters of business. 

The office is over the store of John Kraus & Sons. It is up one flight of stairs. 

It was just a little past 11 o'clock when Mr. Mills got back. He walked up the stairs and entered the room without giving any intimation of what was about to happen or expressing himself in any way regarding his condition. He took his stand by a table in the center-of the room and began talking in a joking way to Thomas Fitzgerald, local agent for the Agricultural Insurance Company, who shared the office with him. 

Mr. Mills had scarcely uttered more than half a dozen words when he tottered and fell like a log, face forward on the floor. 

Mr. Fitzgerald jumped up from his desk and sprang to the side of the prostrate man. He found Mr. Mills unconscious and scarcely breathing. 

Dr. C. R. Jewett was summoned at once, but Mr. Mills died almost before the message reached the physician in his office in the Y. M. C. A. building. When Dr, Jewett arrived he pronounced it a case of apoplexy. 

The deceased was about 60 years old and unmarried. He lived with his sister, Mrs. Martha A. Baker, at 370 Bryant street. Brady & Drullard were notified and the body was conveyed from the office to the house. 

Fleshy men are generally considered more liable to apopleptic attacks than those of lesser weight. Mr. Mills was quite sparsely built and had been in his usual good health for some time past. 

“He couldn’t have died quicker if he had been shot through the brain,” said Mr. Fitzgerald. “He had just come in off the street, put his hand on the table and commenced talking, then dropped full on his face. He never spoke a word afterward, We sent at once for the doctor but Mr. Mills died before the doctor came, maybe before he struck the floor.”
