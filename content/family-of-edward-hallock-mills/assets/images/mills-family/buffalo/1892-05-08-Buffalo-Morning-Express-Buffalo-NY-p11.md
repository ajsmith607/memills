MANY WORDS OF GRIEF.

Tributes to the Memory of Mr. Warren.

Action of the Merchants' Exchange, the Republican League and Other Bodies Upon His Death.

A meeting at the newspaper-men of the city was held at the rooms of the Buffalo Press Club yesterday afternoon with President Charles F. Kingsley in the chair, to take action on the death of Orsamus G. Warren. Brief addresses were made by Messrs. Kingsley, George E. Matthews, Edwin Fleming, Norman E. Mack and Arthur W. Austin, who all paid tribute to his upright and companionable character and to his unswerving loyalty as a friend. The regrets of Mr. E. H. Butler, at his inability to be present, and embodying similar sentiments, were presented. The following resolutions, drafted by a committee composed of Messrs. Mark Bennitt, Charles A. White and George Ferris, were adopted:

The Buffalo Press Club has hoped to be spared for many years the record of death which this day compels.

Orsamus G. Warren's great activity and well-balanced energies conveyed the constant assurance of many added years of usefulness and of successes further to bless his family and all with whom association could not fail to benefit.

This club speaks with gratitude of Mr. Warren's active relations with this fraternity and in appreciation of his abiding interest and thoughtfulness for its well-being. He was proud of the newspaper as an institution and was zealous in advancing its standard and promoting its influence for good. His advice to those with whom he was associated was ever a counseling to a better endeavor. His friendship was something to be highly prized and sacredly preserved. His qualities of mind and heart were understood only to be admired. The impress of his example will be one of enduring force upon the press of this city and State. Words are indeed inadequate to express the emotions of sorrow that we feel or the deep sympathy we have for those who were nearest to him in the holy relations of the home. We have lost a good friend and safe adviser, and his memory we shall ever revere.

It is directed that this tribute be spread upon the records of this club, and that copies hereof be sent to Mr. Warren's family and to the newspapers of Buffalo.

BY THE REPUBLICAN LEAGUE.

The parlors of the White House held a large company last night at the special meeting of the Buffalo Republican League called in memory of Mr. Warren, who was an associate member. The president, Mr. John A. Scatcherd, filled the chair. In calling the meeting to order and explaining its purpose he spoke simply and impressively of Mr. Warren, of the respect and regard in which he had learned to hold him, and of the loyalty and depth of his character. Messrs. Arthur W. Hickman, Martin Clark, Judge E. W. Hatch and N. S. Rosenau followed in brief remarks speaking sympathetically of Mr. Warren's high character and of his service to party and community. The following resolutions drafted by a committee composed of Messrs. George S. Hull, Charles K. Robinson and Edward C. Volger, were adopted:

Whereas, We of the Buffalo Republican League feel that by the sudden death of the Hon. Orsamus G. Warren, in the very prime of a life, full of splendid achievement and rich promise, a man valued and trusted in the councils of the great party to which we owe allegiance, beyond any of his townsmen, the community has sustained a deep and memorable loss, and we are deprived of the advice and assistance of one of our most prominent associate members;

Resolved, That we express the feeling of appreciation for his life and work which must animate us as we recall his many services, as a citizen and a statesman, to the State and Nation, but more particularly to this city, which he loved as his home. While we know that he has so identified himself with her history that his name will be carried to future generations whenever the tale of her development be told, and that it needs no formal tribute to keep his memory green in the minds of those who live today, we would express our admiration for his genius and those rare qualities of mind and character which fitted him by nature for the position of leadership which so long he held; and we would extend our sincere sympathy to his bereaved family and those who are more nearly called to mourn. To this end it is directed that these resolutions be spread upon the minutes of the League.

BY THE REPUBLICAN COMMITTEE.

At a meeting of the Republican Executive Committee, held yesterday afternoon to take action upon Mr. Warren's death, it was moved and carried that a committee of five should be appointed, of which the chair should be one, to draft resolutions. Chairman Urban appointed Messrs. Hefford, Hurd, Sirret, and Bedell. Brief speeches, embodying tributes to Mr. Warren's memory, were made by Messrs. Hefford, Ramsdell and Sirret. The committee decided to attend the funeral in a body and will meet for the purpose at 2 o'clock tomorrow afternoon. The following resolutions were adopted:

The Republican Executive Committee in special meeting assembled, while mournfully bowing to the Almighty's decree which has removed from us our late esteemed and much beloved friend and leader, O. G. Warren, desire to pay a last tribute of respect to his ability as a leader, his loyalty to and sturdy support of Republican principles, and his worth as a man. Twice within recent years the Republican party of Erie County has been called upon to mourn the loss of trusted leaders. In 1886, James D. Warren, for years the recognized and successful head of the party in Wester New York, laid down the sceptor, which, by common consent, was taken up by his son Orsamus G., who has skillfully wielded it for the past six years. In the death of O. G. Warren the party loses a leader of sterling worth and rare ability for organization, an excellent judge of human nature, and a man of unlimited energy. Although giving to politics much thought and effort, it was not in the hope of personal advancement or profit. His was an unselfish devotion to the principles of the party he had espoused. Never seeking office or pecuniary reward, he labored for Republican success with a zeal that knew no bounds. O. G. Warren was peculiarly a man of the people, always approachable and recognizing worth when hidden under the garb of a workingman as readily as when clothed in broadcloth; and hundreds of Republican rand and file mourn his loss today with unfeigned sorrow, because of valuable services rendered. In his loyalty to friends he was stalwart and true, many times suffering undeserved criticism and condemnation because of his steadfast, unswerving adherence to friends with whom he associated.

Resolved, That in the death of O. G. Warren, the members of this committee feel that they have lost a near, dear and sturdy friend; the party an energetic, skillful, and unselfish leader; than an earnest and powerful advocate and defender of Republican principles and sound Republican doctrine has fallen by the way; that the community has lost a valued member and humanity a whole-souled, manly man. 

Resolved, That this committee, on behalf of the Republican party of Wester New York, extends to the widow and bereaved family our heartfelt sympathy and condolence in this hour of their terrible affliction, and hope that they may be sustained and comforted by higher than human power.

Resolved, That an engrossed copy of these resolutions be transmitted to the widow of the deceased, and that, as an outward evidence of the sorrow that fills our hearts, these rooms be properly draped in mourning, and that this committee attend the funeral in a body.

BY THE MERCHANTS' EXCHANGE.

At a meeting of the Merchants' Exchange held yesterday morning, the following was adopted on report of the committee, Messrs. Norman E. Mack, E. H. Butler, George Bleistein and George E. Matthews:

In the death of Orsamus G. Warren the Merchants' Exchange loses a member who was ever alert to the importance of organized effort and ever ready by word and deed to assist in everything tending to the upbuilding of our local institutions and the onward march of Buffalo as a great and growing commercial center.

His death is a loss to the city at large because of his eminent respectability in public and private life; his high standing as the head of a newspaper whose influence for good is known and respected in all sections of the State and country.

To his family, relatives and associates in business we extend our deepest sympathies, assuring them that we share the sorrow and bear in part this burden of grief which is felt throughout the city and State. All who know him regret the sudden call and summons which removed him from the busy field of labor and honest endeavor to the reward he so justly earned and so faithfully strove for.

Resolved; That this memorial minute be spread upon the minutes and a copy signed by the president, secretary and members of the committee be forwarded to the widow of our late beloved friend and associate.

BY THE "COMMERCIAL" EMPLOYEES.

The employees of the newspaper and book and job-printing departments of the *Commercial* adopted the following resolutions at a joint meeting yesterday:

Whereas, Having learned with deep regret of the death of our beloved employer, Orsamus George Warren, we deem it befitting to give expression to our profound sorrow at his untimely demise. In the prime of a useful and busy life, with a bright vista before him, the sudden parting of the golden chain of affection that bound us all so closely to him is but another exemplification of the mysterious ways of Providence. It seems but yesterday that we rejoiced in the sunlight of his presence; today we mourn in the inky shadow with which his decease has so suddenly overwhelmed us. A just man, an honorable man, he was a noble son of a noble sire. It was a privilege to know him, an honor to be his friend. Of generous, sympathetic nature, he was ever ready to aid by word and deed those who appealed to him for counsel and assistance. Long years of intimate business relations ripened into fraternal regard for  him, and his genial, happy disposition will leave a lasting impress upon us whose good fortune it was to serve him. In the death of Mr. Warren we have lost a true friend and a kind employer, our appreciations of whose qualities of head and heart we cannot adequately express in words: therefore, be it

Resolved, That we sincerely mourn his sudden departure from the scene of his early labors, cut down in the prime of vigorous life.

Resolved, That to the bereaved family whom he so dearly loved and whose welfare he so constantly watched, we tender our heartfelt sympathy and condolence, and humbly invoke for them the guardianship of Him who orders all things well.

Resolved, That a copy of this preamble and these resolutions be engrossed and presented to the family of our deceased friend as a token of our sincere regard for him and a memento of our sympathy for those whom he held most dear.

BY THE TRUSTEES OF THE BUFFALO SAVINGS BANK.

The trustees of the Buffalo Savings Bank adopted the following memorial upon the death of Mr. Warren, who was their fellow member, at a special meeting yesterday forenoon:

A few months ago, in seeking among the citizens of Buffalo for one who could worthily fill the place made vacant by the resignation of a valued member of this board, our choice fell upon Orsamus G. Warren. 

Although he has been associated with us but a short time, we have learned to recognize in him those qualities of mind and character which made him a successful business-man, and which enabled him to achieve for himself an honorable position in this community and in the State. Actively engaged in political life, his record has been without blemish; at the head of one of the leading daily journals of the country, he has kept its columns eminently pure and wholesome, and under his supervision its utterances have ever been outspoken in the cause of morality and good government. He was a conspicuous public man. Called by his party and his business associates to high office and places of trust, he always acquitted himself with honor and credit.

Recognizing in him these characteristics which singularly fitted him for a position of responsibility, he was elected a member of this board last December, in the reasonable hope that the institution committed to our care would have the benefit of his sagacious counsel long after the older members of the board should have passed away.

This hope was in vain. In the prime of his life, in the vigor of early manhood, and seemingly at the threshold of his greatest usefulness, Orsamus G. Warren has suddenly been summoned from our councils.

In his death we mourn with the city at large the loss of one who had her best interests at heart and who was active in promoting her growth and prosperity.

We extend to his friends and business associates our sympathy in the loss they have sustained; and we desire to express to the members of his family our profound grief at the bereavement which has cast its dark shadow over their home.

In recognition of his worth, and as a lasting testimony to our sorrow, we direct this memorial to be entered upon the minutes of the board.
