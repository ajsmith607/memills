DEATH OF THOMAS H, MILLS. 

He Was Found Lying Lifeless in a Grove Near the Village of Springville. 

Thomas H. Mills of Bryant street was found dead Wednesday night in a grove near the village of Springville. Death was undoubtedly caused by heart disease. 

For many years Mr. Mills was in the habit of spending his summers in Springville, and for several days had been occupied in laying out croquet grounds in a grove in the rear of Dr. Bates’s residence, near Springville. He was spending the summer with Dr. Bates. 

During the afternoon yesterday Mr. Mills took his horse and went to the grove to finish the work. He was apparently in usual health. About 6 o’clock someone passed through the grove and saw Mr. Mills lying dead on the ground. Help was summoned and the body was carried to the house of Dr. Bates. 

Dr. Brooks, who was sent for, said that Mr. Mills had been dead for some time. The coroner of the south towns was notified. Mr. Mills is survived by a brother and sister, both of whom live in Buffalo, where the body will be brought for burial.
