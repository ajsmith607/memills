THE LATE JAMES D. WARREN, 

Proprietor of the Buffalo Commercial Advertiser, 

Died Friday Evening, Dec. 17, 1886. 

James D. Warren, proprietor of the *Commercial Advertiser*, died quite unexpectedly at half past eight o'clock last evening, at his home on North Street. Though he was known to be seriously ill, no one seems to have been aware of his critical condition until within a few hours of the end. His physicians predicted his recovery only a day or two ago. Though it was known that he did not take this hopeful view of his condition, and it was also known that he had hardly more than an even chance with his disease, it was late yesterday afternoon before any one saw that the end was near.

The disease which terminated fatally made its appearance early in October, and during that month he visited New York to confer with the State Committee, going as a member by proxy. While in. New York Mr. Warren visited, among other friends, ex-President Arthur, finding the latter out of health, and leaving him with a sentiment of deep sadness, feeling and saying that he should never see him again. He came home quite unwell, His trip had failed to do for him what his friends had hoped. He was threatened with local inflammatory troubles of hereditary character and was quite nervous about his condition. From the first he was quite discouraged. His father had died of the same disease, and he believed he was about to follow him. But be struggled against the attack and went to the office for some time. Towards the last of October he was advised by his physician, Dr. J. D, Hill, to stay at home and submit to severe treatment for his disease. He was then threatened with acute inflammation of the bladder, and was obliged to remain at home. 

For a time the disorder appeared to yield to treatment. Mr. Warren arose every day and his friends went to see him. On Election Day they urged him to go out and vote and he was driven to the polls. This was the last day he went out, though he was not materially worse for several days. His physician predicted that if he was patient he would come around all right. But he was not hopeful, and would often say that he had to go. On the Friday before Thanksgiving he felt better than for Several days before, and talked about getting well. On the next day unfavorable symptoms set in and Dr. Burwell was called in for counsel. The Doctor said that while alarming symptoms were present they were not necessarily fatal. Here was a staunch ship, to use Dr, Burwell’s words, that had been sailing over 60 years. The ship had got on the rocks, but he trusted they could float her. 

It was but an even chance, however, after that, and complications appeared during the last three weeks of his life that greatly discouraged his doctors. Precisely what the final ailment was will be revealed only by the autopsy which, on the request of the physicians, is to be held. About ten days ago a swelling appeared on the inner side of his left thigh near the groin. It was at first thought to be merely sympathetic with his bladder trouble, but it did not disappear, and on Dr. Hill's becoming ill, Dr. Roswell Park was called, who, with Dr, Burwell, concluded to open the swelling, on the supposition of its being an abscess. This was done yesterday, the patient appearing to suffer but little from the operation. The doctors predicted that he would improve, but an hour later he suffered a severe chill, followed by a high fever. His temperature rose to 105 and his pulse to 140, and he soon became unconscious, from which state he never rallied, At 4 P. M. his physicians gave up hope, and at 6 they said he must go almost immediately. His iron constitution, however, prolonged life until 8.30, when he passed away without a struggle. 

By his first wife Mr. Warren had one child, Mr. Orsamus G. Warren. Mr. William C. Warren and Mrs. Isaac H. Bromley, Jr., are offspring of the second union. 

EXPRESSIONS OF SORROW. 

Prominent Men Who Knew Mr. Warren Intimately Talk Feelingly about Him. 

Towards the close of the meeting of the General Committee on Charter Revision at the Mayor's office last evening, the news of James D. Warren's death was received by telephone. It was announced very feelingly by Mr. James C. Fullerton, and created profound regret. 

In moving the appointment of a committee of three to draft suitable resolutions, Mr. Fullerton said it was unnecessary for him to say anything in eulogy of a man who commanded so deeply the respect and sympathy of such a body as that present, who knew and appreciated the merits of Mr. Warren as a citizen, and his great services to the community as a public man. He had always placed uppermost in his breast the dictates of duty. 

The motion that the chairman appoint a committee of three to draft suitable resolutions to be presented at the next meeting was seconded by Mayor Becker. The chair appointed Mr. James C. Fullerton, Mr. George Gorham, and Gen. John C. Graves as such committee.

A Banking Friend. 

Gen. Rufus L. Howard, who was called upon at a late hour last night, said that be had been very much surprised at the news of Mr. Warren's death.

Gen. Howard said he hardly felt able that evening to say much with respect to Mr. Warren's life or his personal knowledge of him as a friend. "I have known him," said he, "ever since I came to Buffalo, and have always entertained for him a warm regard. He was a clear-headed, shrewd business man, and in all his business relations, as far as I am enabled to say, was perfectly upright and a pleasant man to meet.

"My business relations with him have been closer since I became Vice-President of the White's Bank. Since his sickness I have taken more or less charge of the bank's affairs and to-morrow I shall call a meeting of the directors, as of course the bank cannot be closed immediately."

A Democratic Friend.

Judge James M. Humphrey, who has known Mr. Warren 35 years, said of him as his own home last night: "He was a remarkably good business-man in every department of business. He was an honest, upright man. He was a profound judge of men–of human nature. He had largely the elements and characteristics that made him a leader among men, in politics especially. He was a strong partisan, yet not so strong as to do injustice to the motives of those opposed to him. He had a strong, decided, and positive convictions, and followed them out with both determination and sagacity. I think him to have been one of the leading men whose opinions and judgment were as highly regarded in the State as any man in his party occupying a private position. He exercised a controlling — a very controlling interest in the political action of his party in this County and had done so for a good many years. Mr. Warren was, moreover, a man of fine social qualities, and genial nature. He appreciated his friends and was true to them. His death will be a great loss to the business community and to his party."

A Business Friend.

Alfred P. Wright, an old friend of Mr. Warren, was grieved to learn of his death. "Personally," said he, "I feel that I have lost a very dear friend. I have known him for a great many years intimately. I have always been associated with him in politics, with the exception of one year, when we differed, but that did not interfere with our personal friendship. He was a strong, sterling, upright man. Occupying the position he did, he could not help making some political mistakes and some political enemies.

"His integrity was above suspicion. He was very strong in his friendships, and had the faculty of holding the friends he made. He was the most lovable man to his family that you can possibly imagine. I feel that the city of Buffalo has lost one of its best men, whose place it will be hard to fill—one who has battled for years for Buffalo and its interests."

A Political Friend.

The Hon. Benjamin H. Williams got the News of Mr. Warren’s death from a reporter for THE EXPRESS. Said he:

“I feel his death is a great personal loss to me on the score of friendship. I had a very high opinion of Mr. Warren as a citizen, and as a man I had a great esteem for him. I regard his death as a great loss, not only to his family but to his immediate friends, the community, and I might also say to the State.”

A Boyhood Friend.

The Hon. Nelson K. Hopkins was deeply grieved when he learned the sad news. “I believe I have been acquainted with Mr. Warren longer than any other man in the city,” said Mr. Hopkins, “having become acquainted with him during his early boyhood. He was, during the early part of his life, a steady, faithful, and industrious young man. When I first knew him he was a clerk in his father’s store in Clarence Hollow. Since he has been a resident of Buffalo, he character has been almost too well known to the public for me to dwell on it. He has always occupied a high and honorable position.

“We have always belonged to the same party. He has achieved a reputation as a citizen and in his party as a gentleman that is not excelled by any other man. He has always been a man of very high character and undoubted integrity. His loss will be greatly felt throughout the entire community.”

The news of Mr. Warren’s death was known down town soon after the sad event occurred, and from all sides were heard expressions of sincere regret. Many old friend of the deceased whom reporters for THE EXPRESS called on last night had either retired or were so overcome at the reception of the sad news that they felt unable to make at that time any adequate expression of their feelings.

IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER.

The formal facts of James D. Warren’s Long and Many-Sided Career.

From Smith’s “History of the City of Buffalo and Erie County.”

James D. Warren was born in the town of Bennington, Wyoming, N. Y., on the 19th of January, 1823. His father, the late Orsamus Warren, was a farmer and one of the pioneers of Wester New York. After a brief residence in Bennington he moved to the town of Wales, Erie County, and from thence shortly afterwards to the town of Clarence, Erie County, where he purchased and settled upon a farm situated about a mile from the village. He also carried on a country store at Clarence, dealing in a general assortment of dry-goods, groceries, and farmer’s implements. 

When the family moved to Clarence the subject of this notice was about two years old. He attended school, wrought upon the farm and assisted his father in the management of the village store. Before attaining his majority Mr. Warren made a tour of the South, spending about a year in Natchez, Miss. Returning North, he engaged in business in Clarence, following mercantile and farming pursuits, and was elected a Supervisor for several terms from that town. In 1854, at the age of 31, Mr. Warren was elected County Treasurer, and served a term of three years. He subsequently held the office of Clerk of the Board of Supervisors for two or three, terms, and in April, 1861, in connection with Joseph Wheeler and Joseph Candee, he purchased the Commercial Advertiser newspaper, and entered upon his life-work,—that of publisher.

In 1863 Messrs. Wheeler and Warren purchased Mr. Candee’s interest, and immediately after Mr. James N. Matthews was admitted into the firm. Mr. Wheeler retired from business some two years afterwards, and the firm then became Matthews & Warren. In 1877 Mr. Warren purchased the interest of his partner in the *Commercial Advertiser,* and has since that time been its sole proprietor and publisher. 

He is an earnest and active Republican, and has been prominently identified with that party since its organization. The only offices he has held, as above stated, are Supervisor, Erie County Treasurer, and Clerk of the Board of Supervisors. He has been active and influential in the direction and management of party affairs, serving repeatedly as a member of the State Central Committee, as well as a delegate to the State and National nominating conventions. He is what is known as a Stalwart Republican, and is the recognized leader of that branch of the party in Erie County, if not in Western New York. His sound good sense, thorough knowledge of human nature, keen observation, valuable experience in affairs, and genial disposition combine to make him not only a successful man in business, but a far-seeing politician as well. Under his direction and management the *Commercial Advertiser* has become the leading Republican newspaper of Western New York.

He is also president of White's Bank, one of the oldest and most substantial financial institutions in Buffalo. Mr. Warren has been twice married—first to Miss Laura Love, daughter of the late George Love, by whom he had one son. After her death he married Miss Mary Mills, daughter of the late Judge Mils of Clarence, by whom he has had one son and two daughters.

THE DEAD POLITICIAN.

What He Did and also What He Was Both in State and National Affairs.

The following sketch of the dead leader’s career in State and National politics is based on material furnished by some of the gentlemen connected with the *Commercial Advertiser* who shared Mr. Warren’s political activity.

Mr. Warren, Mr. Arthur, Mr. Conkling, and Alonzo B. Cornell were the delegates-at-large from New York State to the Republican National Convention in Chicago in 1880. Mr. Warren was one of the leaders in the movement which culminated in the 206 convention votes for Grant. In 1884 he was again a delegate to the Republican National Convention also at Chicago, this time representing his district. At this convention he was the recognized leader of the Arthur forces, and mad a hard fight against Mr. Blaine. On the latter’s nomination Mr. Warren gave him support through his journal, the *Buffalo Commercial Advertiser,* and as the chairman of the Republican Central Committee of New York State.


He was a delegate to every State Convention of his party in New York held since 1872. That was the memorable year in the political management of the State. Mr. Greeley’s candidacy as an independent was a disturbing influence in the Republican party. Up to that time the State machinery had been controlled by Gen. Fenton and his forces, but now it passed into the hands of Senator Conkling and his supporters. From 1872 to 1882 they held the undisturbed control of the party organization.

As a member of the State Central Committee during these years Mr. Warren did eminent work for the party organization. In 1883 he became Chairman of the Committee. That was the year succeeding the Cleveland cyclone, which gave the head of the Democratic ticket 192,000 majority. It was under Mr. Warren’s management that the State was reclaimed to the Republicans by the election of the head of their ticket—Gen. Carr, for Secretary of State—while the Democratic majority for the remainder of the ticket was cut down to the merest margin.

It was at Mr. Blaine’s request that he became chairman of the committee in 1884. Mr. Warren strongly opposed some of the steps of the closing days of that campaign, to which the defeat of Mr. Blaine is commonly attributed. He was opposed to the Delmonico dinner, and counseled against the ministers’ meeting at which the Rev. Dr. Burchard made use of his ill-advised phrase, “Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion.” It was Mr. Warren’s advice that if the meeting be held at all the speakers first write out what they intended to say and submit the manuscript to the party managers; but the National Committee looked upon this as a needless precaution and the advice was disregarded.

Throughout the campaign of 1884 Mr. Warren gave unflagging personal attention to the work. For nearly three months he remained in News York City, almost constantly devoted to the labor of the Committee. The strain was so terrible that he barely escaped prostration, and for this reason firmly declined to go on the Committee again. 

Mr. Warren was prominently mentioned as a candidate for United States Senator when Mr. Evarts was elected, and was a candidate for Governor in the convention of 1885, receiving 138 votes. His name has also been mentioned in connection with the Senatorial election this year.
