James D. Warren. 

Death of the Noted Republican Leader Last Evening. 

A Good Man Gone—Political and Business Career. 

His Early Days..From the Farm to the Sanctum..An Unostentatious But influential Life..Premonitions of the End. 

James D, Warren, proprietor of the *Commercial Advertiser* of this city, died last evening at 8.30 o'clock at his home on North street after a long and very painful illness. The remote cause of death was inflammation of the bladder. Mr. Warren was first taken ill early in October but despite an enervating attack he persisted on going to New York as a proxy on the State committee but returned to this city in a worse state of health than when he departed. 

Mr. Warren was born at Bennington, Wyoming county, N. Y., January 19, 1823. He was a son of Orsamus Warren one of the earliest settlers in the western part of this state. Mr. Warren was a farm bred boy spending most of his time up to the age of 31 in the rural districts. When he was but two years of age his parents moved to Clarence, this county, where they started a store as well as a farm. 

In 1854 Mr. Warren's city life, and in fact his real public career began although he had before that time served several terms as supervisor. In the year named he was elected treasurer of Erie county and soon came into prominence by his wisdom in counsel and earnestness for party. Mr. Warren continued as county treasurer for the term of three years. He was afterwards elected clerk of the board of supervisors, holding that office several years. In April, 1861, he made the most important move in his career, and one by which he was to become a power in the land: with Joseph Wheeler and Joseph Candee he purchased the *Buffalo Commercial Advertiser*. In 1862 one of Mr. Warren’s partners stepped out and James N. Matthews was taken in. A year or two after Jos. Wheeler followed Candee into private life and then was born the firm for years of great power and prominence of Matthews & Warren. For fifteen years the two partners tried to follow the paths of prosperity. Then they separated. With the story of that disunion the Buffalo public is familiar. Since Mr. Matthews’ retirement from the firm Mr. Warren guided its fortunes alone and with continued success. Mr. Warren was at the time of his death the president of White’s bank. He was married twice, first to Miss Laura Love and after her death to Miss Mary Mills. By the first marriage he had one son, Orsamus G. Warren, and by the second one son and two daughters. Mr. Warren leaves surviving him his widow, two sons and one daughter, Mrs. Isaac Bromley, jr.

Many people in the city will sincerely sympathize with the family in their affliction and realize the loss the republican party has sustained in the death of its leader in Erie county.
