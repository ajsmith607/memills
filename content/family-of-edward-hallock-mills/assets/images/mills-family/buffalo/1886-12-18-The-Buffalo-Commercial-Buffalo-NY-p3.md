THE LATE MR. WARREN. 

Action of the Republican Executive Committee.—A Tribute by the "Commercial” Compositors and Employees. 

ACTION OF THE REPUBLICAN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.

At a regular meeting of the Republican Executive Committee of the County of Erie, held at the County Committee Rooms this morning at half-past ten, the following resolutions on the death of Mr. WARREN were unanimously adopted: 

It is with feeling of pained surprise and regret that we learn that JAMES D. WARREN is dead. 

The leader of the Republican party in We New York has passed away, leaving a vacancy in our ranks not soon or easy to be filled. His was the saving common sense on which so often the party has leaned for support; his was the prudent conservatism which demanded time to wisely investigate and carefully act. His was the unswerving fidelity to friends which stood unshaken through good and evil reports and which, though often tried, never failed in the hour of need.

His name will live in the history of the republican party associated with those for whom he toiled and who honored him for his real worth–the genial, whole-souled gentleman, Chester A. Arthur, the noble-minded upright Judge, Charles J. Folger.

Let others tell of his sterling business ability, of his untiring industry and indefatigable perseverance which have placed the moneyless lad among the merchant princes of our city. To us his death comes with a sense of personal bereavement. We shall miss his noble presence, his unfailing courage, his manly hope. We shall miss his words of wise counsel, his knowledge of men and affairs. We are sensible that in the structure of Republicanism a great pillar has fallen and contemplating the space it has left, we realize that the loss exceeds any mere private grief and becomes a public calamity. On the shaft which may honor his memory might well be written the two words which best describe his character “Firm and True.” We do not venture to intrude into the private grief of his family circle. In a tribute of deep sympathy in this hour of affliction we respectfully unite with all citizens of the city which he loved so much and which honored and respected him.

In honor of his memory our rooms shall be draped in mourning for the space of thirty days.

ACTION OF THE “COMMERCIAL” NEWSROOM COMPOSITORS. 

A meeting of the compositors of the COMMERCIAL newsroom was held at noon today to take action on the death of Mr. WARREN. The foreman, Mr. N. W. Thayer, was called to the chair, and Mr. Anthony W. Landsittel chosen secretary. On motion, a committee consisting of Ferdinand Puls, George F. Hilbert. Don Wight, Herman Metke, and Judson A. Taylor, was appointed, to prepare a suitable memorial. They reported the following which was unanimously adopted: 

We, the compositors and employees of the BUFFALO COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER'S news room wish to put on record some expression of the sorrow with which the death of JAMES D. WARREN our late employer and friend bas filled us. 

MR. WARREN has been to all of us, as an employer, as fair and just as man could be. He never made a promise that he did not fulfill to the letter. He never encouraged hopes that he had reason to believe could not be realized. What he said to us we knew he meant; we knew that it could be depended upon. 

Many of us have gone to MR. WARREN in times of trouble for counsel or for assistance. It is a pleasure, as well as a duty, to say at this time that we never failed to get good advice, real sympathy and judicious aid. Our employer was always our kindly well-wisher and true friend. We mourn his too-early death sincerely and beg his sorrowing family to accept our sympathy and this memorial as a proof of our real affection for MR. WARREN, and our regard for those he loved best. 

ACTION OF EMPLOYEES OF THE JOB DEPARTMENT. 

A meeting of the employees of the job department of the COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER Printing House, was held at 1 o'clock this afternoon, to take action on the death of MR. WARREN. Mr. F. R. Turner presided, and a committee, consisting of Jacob Pfohl, Alfred Paddon and C. J. Wolfe was appointed on resolutions. They reported the following memorial which was adopted: 

We, the employees of the COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER job-printing department, feel deeply grieved at the untimely death of our honored friend and employer, MR. JAMES D. WARREN. We bear testimony to the fact that he was always kind and considerate in his treatment of us, and we, one and all, had reason to regard him as a kind, just and consistent friend. 

As an employer he had our fullest respect. We admired his many noble qualities and the justness of his dealings. To his family we offer our deepest sympathy in this the time of their great loss and assure them that we too are mourners. 

MR. WARREN'S sterling qualities of heart and mind are too well-known to the community at large to need extended eulogy at our hands, but it is at such a time as this that we can best appreciate his great worth and feel the deep loss that has fallen upon us. 

He was fair and honorable to all, We deeply deplore his loss, and sincerely regret that death has severed the pleasant relations always sustained between him and those who entered his service.
