**Death of Robert Mills.**

Robert Mills, ex-police commissioner and a well known citizen of Buffalo, died at his residence on Prospect avenue of apoplexy early this morning.

Mr. Mills was born in Toronto, November 17, 1824, and came to Buffalo when 12 years of age. He began as a cabin boy on the schooner John E. Hunt, and from this humble position he soon became the master of a vessel, next an owner and at last half owner of the Mills & Walsh ship yard. In political matters Mr. Mills was also very prominent. He was twice elected alderman of the Eighth ward on the Republican ticket and was chairman of the Republican county committee from 1868 to 1874. In 1880 he was appointed police commissioner by Mayor Brush, a position which he held with honor and remarkable executive ability for the good of the department.

In 1845 he was married to Margaret A. Cherry of Chautauqua county by whom he had two sons and one daughter all of whom are living.
