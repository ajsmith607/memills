THE LATE MR. WARREN. 

FUNERAL SERVICES HELD YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.

Address by the Rev. Dr. Smith.—Further Memorial Tributes.

The funeral services of the late MR. JAMES D. WARREN were held yesterday afternoon at the family residence on North street, and were simple and unostentatious in their character. The attendance was very large, including many prominent citizens and old personal friends of the deceased, besides public officials and others. The remains reposed in a solid cedar casket, covered with fine black broadcloth, concave top, and ornamented with a silk cord that extended around it, with tassels at each end. It was lined with pleated satin richly trimmed and had oxydized silver extension bar and end handles. A solid silver plate bore the following inscription:

JAMES D. WARREN

BORN, JAN. 19, 1823.

DIED, DEC. 17, 1886.

The floral tributes were few in number, in accordance with the wishes of the family, and including two offering from employes of the COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER establishment, and a wreath from the carrier-boys. 

The portrait of the late Ex-President Chester A. Arthur was draped with smilax. In this connection is it proper to state, that MR. WARREN’S physicians, fearing the depressing effect of the sad news, advised that he be not informed of the ex-president’s death, and he left the world without knowing that his distinguished friend had passed away.

Among those present at the obsequies from out of town were United States Senator Warner Miller, Congressman John B. Weber, the Hon. Andrew S. Draper, state superintendent of education; ex-Congressman James S. Smart, the Hon. Charles W. Hackett, chairman of the executive committee of the republican state committee; John A. Sleicher, editor of the *Albany Journal;* the Hon. Carroll Whittaker, Saugerties, N. Y.; the Hon. John M. Davy, Rochester; Willard A. Cobb, editor of the *Lockport Journal;* the Hon. Richard Crowley, Lockport, O. W. Cutler of the *Lockport Union;* Assemblyman Peter A. Porter, Niagara Falls; H. H. Warner, Rochester; Senator T. Ellsworth, Lockport; Charles E. Johnson, Philadelphia; Henry Abel, formerly of Governor Cornell’s staff; ex-Internal Revenue Collector Pierce of Canandaigua, and Dr. James of Lancaster.

From this city and vicinity there were representatives of all the political organizations, the Cleveland Democracy sending a delegation to be present along with similar delegations from the republican bodies. The Republican League, the Buffalo Press club, the city and county hall officials were well represented. Among those observed in the throng were Mayor Becker, the Hon. James O. Putnam, the Hon. E. G. Spaulding, the Hon. Daniel N. Lockwood, Charles W. Goodyear, the Hon. E. W. Hatch, George C. Green, the Hon. D. H. McMillan, Isaac M. Schermerhorn, the Hon. Albert Haight, George Bleistein, Edwin Fleming, the Rev. Patrick Cronin, Dr. J. D. Hill, Dr. R. V. Pierce, Dr. A. H. Briggs, Dr. Charles Ring, George Dunbar, E. P. Hays, Ogden P. Letchworth, Herbert P. Bissell, Herman Hennig, W. F. Mackey, George Bell, E. H. Tuthill, Corporation Counsel Worthington, H. S. Thayer, D. J. Kenefick, Anselm J. Smith, R. R. Hefford, F. F. Fargo, Frank A. Sears, C. Weyland, John Otto, Merritt Nichols, the Rev. Dr. Hubbell, the Rev. Oliver J. Booth, J. Adam Lautz, County Clerk Orr, Assemblyman Edward Gallagher and many others.

The officiating clergyman was the Rev. T. Ralston Smith, D. D., pastor of Westminster Presybterian church, who delivered the following funeral address:

The holy offices of the church speak to our hearts the words that we most need to hear. The utterances of man are as nothing in the presence of God’s voice of pity and lover. It is a still, small voice, but it can be heard by the listening soul amidst the wildest raging of the tempest, “Be silent, and know that I am God.” We do know it, in the manifestation of His power. Shall we not also know it, in the sweet experience of his Fatherly help and consolation.

When such a man as JAMES D. WARREN is suddenly removed from a large sphere of activity and influence, it is difficult to avoid referring, even in a service which is meant only fro the comfort of a sorrowing home, to the place he has filled and the work he has done. I am specially restricted, however, by the sacred wishes of his family, to the fewest possible and the simplest words. His eulogy has already been written. His life has been open to the inspection of a generation. The impress of his work is too deep to be lost or forgotten soon. The solemnities of this hour are rather for the heart of affection, which looks at things commonly secluded from the observation of the world, and worth more, to the memory of the loving, than all the victories and distinctions of public life. It is the husband and father who is mourned and wept for, even more than the man who has formed opinion and disciplined others for work, and made his mark on the history of the times.

Yet even in the brief words allowed me, may I say, with no purpose of mere eulogy, that our departed friend was a man who has filled, and filled well, a position of honorable elevation, of weighty cares and large responsibilities. He entered political life at a comparatively early age, and has been devoted to its interests ever since. From such a life conflicts are inseparable. But he bore his part in them manfully, so that even those who were in form his antagonists, but at heart his friends, are foremost in paying respectful and affectionate tribute to his memory, and to the marked achievements of his busy career. That he found satisfaction in his chosen calling there can be no question. But it is doubtless true that honor, and the care that comes with it, were finally pressed upon him beyond the point of his desire; and we have sad reason for fearing now, beyond the power of even his splendid physique to endure. But where he served he served diligently and well. A man of few words, and those words plain, direct and forcible, a man of pronounced executive ability—a man adapted to lead, and to inspire where he led, he has been a marked figure not only in the city in which he lived, but in the state, and even in the nation. His loss, in this public sphere, will be felt, has been felt most deeply, already. Those who were with him and those who differed with him, vie in their testimonials of respect and honor.

Possibly, however, Mr. WARREN’S ambition was gratified even more by his success as a newspaper man, and as the conductor of a business which has been identified for years with his name not only, but his actual and efficient personality. If he had chosen his monument, I think he should have chosen this. His mind, his force, his enthusiasm, his love, were incorporated in it. He thus became the architect of an edifice whose materials and proportions clearly manifest to us what he was. It is no wonder if he felt and honest price in his achievements. But it was a pride which did not suffocate those greater feelings which endear mend to those who share their toil. One of the beautiful things which casts a mellow light upon this hour of sorrow, is voluntary testimony of those in his employ that they can recall no harsh, or overbearing, or unjust word, in all the course of their relations with him. It is sweet to think, that despite all the temptations of a public life, those who knew Mr. WARREN best, think of him today chiefly as the tried, the true, and the trustworthy friend. But there is something to be said that rises higher even than the encomiums of those who know him in this outer life. We are in danger of supposing that men of broad public relations have little time, possibly little inclination, for the endearments and quiet enjoyments of home. But this certainly was not true of our own lamented friend. He magnified the domestic life. He was loved in his home as the true man should be and will be loved. Happy in these relations and blessed by Providence with the means of making his home attractive and beautiful, I cannot doubt that he turned to its sweet retirement, from every other scene, however, fascinating, with the keenest relish for the love and sympathy which always awaited him here. If in business he occupied a high place, if in public affairs he wielded a wide influence, if in friendship he was liberal and helpful, the highest throne he occupied was the throne he built in the loving hearts that most deeply mourn for him today.

It is only a few short weeks since he took by the hand a distinguished citizen to whose fortunes he had steadfastly been allied, and bade him a last and tender farewell. He left him with the words ringing in his ears, “Mr. WARREN, I love you.” In a little while that friend passed beyond the reach and need of earthly honor. Who could have supposed that the strong man who stood by that feeble form would follow in the same journey so soon? And this involves even a more sorrowful and tearful leave-taking. Wife and children, brothers and sisters, forgetting the outer life, think, this moment only of the dear inmate of the home, of the man on whom they leaned, whose heart they knew, whose higher qualities were reserved for enjoyment, whose place as husband, and father, and brother, must forever remain unfilled. 

There is an element of mystery in the bereavement before which we can only bow the head in solemn and waiting reverence. Why this friend, in the very prime of life, in the fullness of his power, and at a time when he never seemed to be more needed in the household circle, should suddenly be smitten down, is a question which we can only leave to the sovereign wisdom of our Heavenly Father. If our own children cannot search our thoughts, how can we search God’s? Yet we expect our children to be docile and submissive, to have faith in us, to be assured of our love. Shall we have less trust in the infinite wisdom and the infinite goodness? I know the weakness of human hearts, especially in crushing sorry. I know the temptations to doubt and murmuring. I know how the question rises, why, why, must this be so? And it is a question which we cannot answer. But we can stretch forth our hands to God and humbly say: “It is best, because thou doest it. We cannot understand the way by which thou dost lead us; but it is thy way, and thou art love.” The lesson of resignation is a hard lesson to learn, but it is a sweet one. We have to rise up to great heights of confidence before we can say, “the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.” But his own hand can lift us to these heights, and his own grace can put these patient and trustful words upon our lips and in our hearts.

These sorrowing ones today can find a wondrously large infusion of sweetness in the bitter elements of the cup they drink. They can remember the beauty of the home life with its unbroken confidences. They can remember how earthly honors and duties never eclipsed the light of domestic love. They can recall heroic patience in suffering, thoughtfulness for others even during the paroxysms of pain, the gentle ministries of affection which they were permitted to exercise, and the death at last coming like sleep to a tired child. Even more, they can think of the promised sympathy of Him who is so sweetly described as the judge of the widow and the father of the fatherless; of the sympathizing Jesus, who, as we are reminded by the season, coming into our nature through the comeliness and helplessness of childhood, partook of sorrow beyond the measure of our humanity, and know how to sympathize with every burdened and bleeding heart. 

May God’s peace come into these sorrow-stricken bosoms; may the arm of Jesus be felt in it strong embrace of these forms stunned and staggering beneath the force of this weight blow. There is no night so dark but the light of Christ can brighten it into day. There is no sorrow so deep but that divine comfort can burn it into peace and joy. There are no tears that the hand of heavenly love cannot wipe away.

At the conclusion of the services the casket was borne to the hearse. The honorary pall bearers were: Hon. Chas. Daniels, General R. L. Howard, Hon. N. K. Hopkins, Hon. J. M. Humphrey, John L. Williams, Henry W. Box, Hon. Solomon Scheu, Robert Keating.

The following named gentlemen were the bearers:

James A. Roberts, George Urban, Jr., Col. John Byrne, Judge George A. Lewis, Hon. Jacob Stern, Henry C. French, William E. Clark, William B. Sirret.

The long line of carriages then started for Forest Lawn. The members of the family were followed by a few personal friends and members of the COMMERCIAL staff. 

The remains were deposited temporarily in the receiving vault. Prayer was offered by the Rev. Oliver J. Booth, and the committal sentences were read by the Rev. Dr. Smith.

THE TRIBUTE OF THE OFFICIALS

At the meeting of the city and county officials at the Mayor’s office yesterday to take action on the death of Mr. WARREN, Judge-elect Edward W. Hatch spoke as follows:

In the course of nature, such scenes as we are now witnessing must often occur. We may speculate much or little over the cause of death. We may assign reason why life should have been prolonged in a given case. We may question the skill of physicians. We may rebel and doubt eve the justice of God; but to all of us comes the dread messenger, and neither speculation, skill or rebellion suffices to drive him away. I stand today by the open grave of my friend, and am consoled only by the knowledge, common to all, that he died as a man should die, which honors thick upon him, taking with him the love of friends, conscious of his own rectitude, commanding the respect of his enemies. 

This is no ordinary man we bury this day; living, he was our first citizen. There were more men who knew him and paid homage to his unostentatious greatness than any other in our city and I can truthfully add in our state.

It has been truthfully said that MR. WARREN was a leader of men. He was also a leader of measures. In all my intercourse with him I found him to be one of the best I ever knew—ready at all times to receive suggestions, to hear all one had to day, and I think if the suggestion was good his ready comprehension accepted it—but he reserved to himself the right of final judgment, and this I round to be true, great or small. When once he had reached a conclusion, it was usually acceptable. He had no dogmatic assertion about him, nor offensive manner, nor much gift of language to enforce he views; nevertheless no one failed of understanding his positions and knowing his reasons for it.

He was no half-way man. While there were one hundred and one things and person that he never troubled himself about, although others persistently said he did, yet when he did interest himself all could know of it, and also where he stood and what interest he was for. 

So strong was he as a leader of measures and of men in this state that, had his desire, if had one, been made from his sick bed, it would have had an undoubted influence on shaping the destiny of the state in the senate of the United States. Could this power come to one save he were made upon a broad gauge a great man? The princely property he left behind, earned by himself, is its own testimonial to his capacity as a business man. 

But there was a tenderer relation which he occupied than what has been said would seem to imply. He gathered his friends about him, and no act or word of his ever did aught but contribute to their happiness. I think he was at all times ready to meet the highest or the lowest. No power of wealth of station ever awed him, no arrogance ever obtruded itself upon his lowliest friend.

He had a gracious temper. Who ever saw his equipoise disturbed? I doubt if his friends every saw him disturbed to what is called a loss of temper; he often felt wronged and so expressed himself, but as for getting mad as commonly accepted, he was as far from it as the howling blast is from balmy summer air. 

There was one power possessed by our dead friend with which we rarely meet. I wish I could tell it better than I shall.

Between himself and his two sons there existed a confidence and affection which is rarely met with. It was a ease of mutual confidence always maintained. The roots of affection usually reach downward from the parent to the child. Warm constant companionship, producing affections, spreads its roots in all directions, including the heart. That such as the relation between Mr. WARREN and his sons, no one who knew them could help observing. 

He made his companionship acceptable in the highest and best sense to them, one never ashamed that his act should be known to the other. To my mind this is the highest and best possible relation which can exist today. The sons mourn the loss, not only of illustrious father, but of the illustrious friend and companion.

I can pay no higher tribute to JAMES D. WARREN. I loved him as a friend. We did not misunderstand each other. I shall always recollect that this day from the face of man is lade the remains of a noble man. 

Brief remarks were also made by Judge L. L. Lewis, Judge Robert C. Titus and Police Commissioner I. O. Crissy.

A committee consisting of Judges Lewis and Titus, Frank C. Laughlin, Superintendent-of-Education J. F. Crooker and County-Treasurer John Esser reported the memorial which was printed in the COMMERCIAL’S noon edition yesterday.

THE CLEVELAND DEMOCRACY

The Cleveland Democracy assembled at their rooms at 1.30 and appointed the following members a committee to attend the funeral of MR. WARREN: Herbert P. Bissell, William F. Mackey, Herman Hennig, Allen Brown, W. H. Cuddeback. 

Appropriate action will be taken by the club at its meeting next Monday night.

ACTION OF THE COMMON COUNCIL

Immediately after the calling of the roll and the approval of minutes, at the council meeting yesterday afternoon, Ald. Rano offered the following, which was unanimously adopted:

In the death of JAMES D. WARREN, the members of the common council of the city of Buffalo recognize the loss of a citizen to whom the city is greatly indebted for its rapid growth and increasing prosperity. Watchful of interests and quick to detect what would make for its advancement, his advice was as hopeful as it was unselfish. He belonged to no ward, he spoke for no class. His active sympathies and liberal views made him preeminently a constituent of each member of this body. During a long and eventful business life, made more conspicuous by his connection with the press, it is difficult to recall a word written or spoken which did not breathe a loyalty to the city of his adoption, born of a desire to make it a city of wealth and progress, of happy homes and of good government, inexpensively and honestly administered.

Resolved, That this expression of our estimate of his services and character be spread upon the minutes, and an engrossed copy presented to the family of the deceased.

ACTION OF THE UNION VETERAN LEGION

AT a meeting of the Union Veteran Legion last evening, the following memorial was unanimously adopted:

The Union Veteran Lodge of Erie county, of which he was an honorary member, have experienced like this community at large a great loss in the death of JAMES D. WARREN. A self-made man whose struggles in early life were typical of a prominent trait in American civilization, he gradually advanced to the front in financial success, and political life. While singularly free from personal ambition, he nevertheless impressed his individual power with unusual force upon party action and party methods. Always clear and direct in the presentation of what he believed to be correct, and the proper thing to be done in any emergency, whatever that emergency might be, his loss will be most keenly felt by his old associates, who must now wear the mantle that he so adorned and so dignified. The republican party not only locally, but throughout the state, has lost one of its strongest pillars—a man as prompt in action as wise in council, and one who judgment, had it been deferred to, would on on specially memorable occasion have save the party from a national defeat.

As the world goes, his life was a most decided success, and younger men can look back upon it with encouragement not only, but realizing that in it there is for them a stimulus of their own advancement and their own prosperity.

Lives are valuable in the lessons they teach and the legacy that Mr. WARREN has left in this regard cannot fail of creating a profound impression in this city especially, where he was so well known and highly esteemed.

With their fellow-citizens the members of this Legion unite in a common sorrow, and they extend to the bereaved family their most profound and heartfelt sympathy.

A. W. BISHOP,

JOHN S. ROBERTSON,

Committee.
