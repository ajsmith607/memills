AT REST. 

THE DEATH OF MR. JAMES D. WARREN. 

Sketch of His Life, and Political Career.— Expressions of Sorrow at His Demise. 

The death of MR. JAMES D. WARREN occurred last evening at 8.30, at his residence on North street. The sad news quickly became generally known throughout the city, and heartfelt expressions of regret and sorrow were heard on every hand. Toward those most deeply bereaved, the sentiment of sympathy and condolence was universal. 

Mr. WARREN'S illness dates from early in October. He went to New York to confer with the Republican State Committee, and returned quite indisposed, being threatened with local inflammatory troubles. Toward the last of October his physician, Dr. J. D. Hill, advised him to remain at home, and submit to treatment, which he did. The last time be was out was on election day, when he visited the polls and cast his vote. For a time his ailment apparently yielded to treatment, and hopes of his recovery were confidently expressed. 

On the Friday before Thanksgiving he felt better than for several days previous. On the next day unfavorable symptoms set in and Dr. Burwell was called in as counsel. The doctor said that while alarming symptoms were present they were not necessarily fatal. Here was a staunch ship to use Dr. Burwell’s words, that had been sailing over 60 years. The ship had got on the rocks, but he trusted they could float her. New complications, however, arose, and about ten days ago a swelling, supposed to be an abcess, began to develop on the left thigh, near the groin. 

It was at first thought to be merely sympathetic with his bladder trouble, but it did not disappear, and on Dr. Hill’s becoming ill, Dr. Roswell Park was called, who, with Dr. Burwell, concluded to open the swelling, on the supposition of its being an abcess. The operation was performed yesterday and the patient bore it with the utmost courage. An hour later he suffered a severe chill, followed by a high fever. His temperature rose to 105 and his pulse to 140, and he soon became unconscious, from which state he never rallied. Late in the afternoon the physicians gave up hope and, at 8.30, he ceased to breathe, and passed peacefully away. 

SKETCH OF HIS LIFE, 

JAMES D. WARREN was born in the town of Bennington, Wyoming county, N. Y., on the 19th of January, 1823. His father, the late Orsamus Warren, was a farmer and one of the pioneers of Western New York. After a brief residence in Bennington he moved to the town of Wales, Erie county, and from thence shortly afterwards to the town of Clarence, Erie county, where be purchased and settled upon a farm situated about a mile from the village. He also carried on a country store at Clarence. When the family moved to Clarence the subject of this notice was about two years old. He attended school, wrought upon the farm and assisted his father in the management of the village store. Before he attained his majority MR. WARREN made a tour of the South, spending about a year in Natchez, Miss. Returning North, he engaged in business in Clarence, following mercantile and farming pursuits, and was elected a Supervisor for several terms from that town. In 1854, at the age of 31, Mr. WARREN was elected County Treasurer, and served a term of three years. He subsequently held the office of Clerk of the Board of Supervisors for two or three terms, and in April, 1861, in connection with Rufus Wheeler and Joseph Candee, he purchased the COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER, and thus began his career as a publisher, which he continued the time of his death. In 1862 Messrs. Wheeler and Warren purchased Mr. Candee's interest, and immediately after Mr. James N. Matthews was admitted into the firm. Mr. Wheeler retired from business some years afterwards, and the firm then became Matthews & Warren. In 1877 the partnership was dissolved, Mr. Matthews retiring, and since then Mr. WARREN the thenceforth to had been sole proprietor of the COMMERCIAL. 

MR. WARREN had been for some years president of White’s Bank of Buffalo. He was twice married, his first wife being Miss Laura Love, daughter of the late George Love; by her he had one son, Mr. Orsamus G. Warren. His second wife, who survives him, was Miss Mary Mills, daughter of the late Judge Mills, of Clarence, by whom he had one son, Mr. William C. Warren, and two daughters, the eldest of whom is the wife of Mr. Isaac Bromley. 

MR. WARREN'S POLITICAL CAREER. 

The deceased early in life manifested an active interest in public affairs, and up to the day of prostration by his fatal sickness he took a deep, active and earnest interest in politics. His last trip to New York city, made when he should have been at home, was in the interest of the republican cause, and to counsel with republican friends. Before leaving Clarence be became the recognized leader of his party in the town, and upon removal to the city at once acquired prominence in city and state political affairs. During the protracted and hard struggle which transferred the management and control of republican affairs in this state from the friends of the late Senator Fenton to those of Senator Conkling, MR. WARREN took a conspicuous and active part.  

He was a delegate to the Syracuse convention of 1871 in which those two political giants had their last encounter, and had a solid Conkling delegation from Erie county behind him. Mr. WARREN was a delegate to nearly every state convention from that time until 1885. He was also a member of the state committee during the greater part of that period, and he was forced into the chairmanship in 1883, the year after the great Cleveland cyclone, when the republican ranks in this state were badly broken and the party greatly demoralized. He succeeded so well in bringing the contending factions together that the State was reclaimed to the republicans by the election of the head of their ticket—Gen. Carr, for secretary of state —while the democratic majority for the remainder of the ticket was cut merest margin. Because of his success on that occasion and his manifest desire to deal fairly and honorably with all republicans regardless of past factional differences, Mr. Blaine personally urged him, although the leader of the Arthur forces at Chicago, to take the chairmanship of the state committee in the presidential campaign. MR. Warren strongly opposed some of the steps of the closing days of that campaign, to which the defeat of Mr. Blaine is directly attributable. He was opposed to the Delmonico dinner, and counseled against the ministers’ meeting at which the Rev. Dr. Burchard made use of his ill-advised phrase, "Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion.” It was Mr. Warren's judgment that if the meeting was held at all the speakers should first write out what they intended to say and submit the manuscript to the party managers, but the national committee looked upon this as a needless precaution and the advice was disregarded. 

Throughout the campaign of 1884 MR. WARREN gave unflagging personal attention to the work. He spent nearly three months in New York city, devoting all his time and attention to the labor of the committee. The strain was so terrible that he barely escaped nervous prostration, and for this reason firmly declined to go on the committee again. 

Mr. Warren was a delegate-at-large to the National republican convention at Chicago in 1880, the other three delegates-at-large being Senator Conkling, General Arthur and Governor Cornell. He was one of General Grant's leaders in that convention, and one of the memorable 306 who stood solidly by their soldier candidate to the end. He was again a delegate to the National republican convention in 1884, and was the recognized leader of Artbur’s forces in that convention, for whom he had the greatest admiration and the warmest love. This latter sentiment was reciprocated by General Arthur. On the occasion of MR. WARREN’S last visit to New York, in October last, alluded to above, he called upon his dear friend, on who hand of death was then heavily resting. When taking his leave of him MR. WARREN could not restrain his feelings, realizing that it would be the last time he would ever see him on earth. Arthur took his hand in both of his, exclaiming, with deep emotion: “WARRREN, I love you, and always have!” 

Mr. WARREN’S name was prominently canvassed in connection with the United-States senatorship, when Mr. Evarts was elected. He was a candidate for the nomination for governor in the Saratoga convention of 1885, receiving 138 votes.

** Expressions of Sorrow.** 

At the meeting of the Charter Revision Committee at the Mayor’s office last evening, the death of MR. WARREN was announced, in feeling terms, by Mr. James C. Fullerton. In moving the appointment of a committee of three to draft suitable resolutions, Mr. Fullerton said it was unnecessary for him to say anything in eulogy of a man who commanded so deeply the respect and sympathy of such a body as that present, who knew and appreciated the merits of Mr. WARREN as a citizen, and his great services to the community as a public man. He had always placed uppermost in his breast the dictates of duty. The motion that the chairman appoint a committee of three to draft suitable resolutions to be presented at the next meeting was seconded by Mayor Becker. The chair appointed Mr. James C. Fullerton, Mr. George Gorham and Gen. John C. Graves. 

The *Courier* of this morning in announcing the death of MR. WARREN, says:

One of the best and most valuable citizens Buffalo ever had was lost when at half-past eight o'clock last evening, at his residence on North street, JAMES D. WARREN died. He had lain for several weeks on a bed of extreme suffering, with life from day to day trembling in the balance—a report of slight improvement occasionally relieving the solicitude of the community, only to be quickly followed by the intelligence that the promise of the symptoms had proven fallacious—yet to those who saw him but a comparatively little while ago in apparently rugged health and with an intellect a tower of strength, his taking off must seem a sudden dispensation. In the city of his home MR. WARREN’s death will be universally mourned; and the mourning will extend far beyond its borders, for his acquaintance throughout the state, and indeed the nation, was large, his reputation being that of a sturdily honest, and to an extent self-made man who did important service in the councils of the party of his preference and would perhaps have received high political honors had his life been prolonged. Quick witted, with broad intellectual grasp, and the peculiar faculty for managing men, MR. WARREN was long a recognized power in the local political and business spheres. He loved Buffalo and was always ready with his support for what he conceived to be its best interests. 

The *Express* contains brief interviews with several well-known personal friends of MR. WARREN, which are herewith reprinted: 

A BANKING FRIEND. 

Gen. Rufus L. Howard, who was called upon at a late hour last night, said that he had been very much surprised at the news of MR. WARREN'S death.  

Gen. Howard said he hardly felt able that evening to say much with respect to MR. WARREN’s life or his personal knowledge of him as a friend. "I have known him,” he said, “ever since I came to Buffalo, and have always entertained for him a warn regard. He was a clear-headed, shrewd business man, and in all his business relations, as far as I am enabled to say, was perfectly upright and a pleasant man to meet. 

“My business relations with him have been closer since I became Vice-President of White's Bank. Since his sickness I have taken more or less charge of the bank’s affairs, and tomorrow I shall call a meeting of the directors, as of course the bank cannot be closed immediately.” 

A DEMOCRATIC FRIEND. 

Judge James M. Humphrey, who has known MR. WARREN 35 years, said of him at his own home last night: "He was a remarkably good business man in every department of business, He was an honest, upright man. He was a profound judge of men—of human nature. He had largely the elements and characteristics that made him a leader among men, in politics especially. He was a strong partisan, yet not so strong as to do injustice to the motives of those opposed to him. He had strong, decided, and positive convictions, and followed them out with both determination and sagacity. I think him to have been one of the leading men whose opinions and judgment were as highly regarded in the state as any man in his party occupying a private position, He exercised a controlling—a very controlling interest in the political action of his party in this county and had done, so for a good many years. MR. WARREN was, moreover, a man Of fine social qualities, and genial nature. He appreciated his friends and was true to them. His death will be a great loss to the business community and to his party.” 

A BUSINESS FRIEND. 

Alfred P. Wright, an old friend of MR. WARREN, was grieved to learn of his death. “Personally,” said he, "I feel that I have lost a very dear friend. I have known him for a great many years, intimately. I have always been associated with him in politics, with the exception of one year, when we differed, but that did not interfere with our personal friendship. He was a strong, sterling, upright man. Occupying the position he did, he could not help making some political mistakes and some political enemies. 

“His integrity was above suspicion. He was very strong in his friendships, and had the faculty of holding the friends he made. He was the most lovable man to his family that you can possibly imagine. I feel that the city of Buffalo has lost one of its best men, whose place it will be hard to fill—one who has battled for years for Buffalo and its interests." 

A POLITICAL FRIEND. 

The Hon. Benjamin H. Williams got the news of MR. WARREN'S death from a reporter of the *Express*. Said he: 

“I feel his death is a great personal loss to me on the score of friendship. I had a very high opinion of MR. WARREN as a citizen, and as a man I had great esteem for him. I regard his death as a great loss, not only to his family but to his immediate friends, the community, and I might also say to the state.” 

A BOYHOOD FRIEND. 

The Hon. Nelson K. Kopkins was deeply grieved when he learned the sad news. "I believe I have been acquainted with MR. WARREN longer than any other man in the city,” said Mr. Hopkins, "having become acquainted with him during his early boyhood. He was during the early part of his life, a steady, faithful and industrious young man. When I first knew him he was a clerk in his father’s store in Clarence Hollow. Since he has been a resident of Buffalo, his character has been almost too well known to the public for me to dwell on it. He has always occupied a high and honorable position. 

"We have always belonged to the same party. He has achieved a reputation as a citizen and in his party as a gentleman that is not excelled by any other man. He has always been a man of very high character and undoubted integrity. His loss will be greatly felt throughout the entire community.”
