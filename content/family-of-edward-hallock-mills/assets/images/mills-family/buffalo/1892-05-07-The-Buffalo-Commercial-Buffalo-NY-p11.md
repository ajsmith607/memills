THE FATAL SICKNESS. 

DETAILS OF MR. WARREN’S LAST HOURS 

A Quick, Sharp Struggle with Congestion, and when it Was Conquered the Vitality Was Gone—Sweet-Natured and Gentle as a Woman to the End. 

Many who knew Mr. O. G. Warren in life will be interested in knowing how he died—something of the details of the fatal illness that struck him down so quickly in the full flower of his manhood. It is a brief story, the story of a few days, for it was a quick, sharp struggle that was all over almost before it was fully realized that he was dangerously ill. 

The physician in charge of the case furnished the following details this morning: 

Mr. Warren came home last week after a tiresome trip, during which he had spent three nights in a sleeping car, and almost immediately went to the State Convention. On Friday he returned, tired out, exhausted, feeling badly. He went home about noon feeling chilly, unable to get warm. 

His sensations amounted almost to a severe chill. This was followed by fever. The doctor saw him shortly afterwards, and Mr. Warren said he had taken cold at the State convention, and had told ex-Senator McMillan and others that he was taking cold. He told the doctor that he was tired out, wanted some simple remedy and would be all right shortly. The doctor sent him to bed, and gave him some remedies, but the patient did not improve. Saturday morning he felt about the same, though looking badly. Then the doctor gave him a thorough examination. Only fever was found, but it was not a simple fever. The lungs had no bad symptoms whatever at this time. On Sunday the doctor became suspicious of the lungs, but there was no inflammation. Mr. Warren had uneasiness, muscular aches about the chest. On Monday there was still nothing wrong with the lungs; the doctor was watching them very closely. 

Tuesday morning there appeared a consolidation of the upper part of the left lung in the rear. On Wednesday morning this consolidation had involved the whole front part of the left lung, but was not now, strange to say, noticeable in the posterior portion. All this time there had been a moderate fever. Mr. Warren, up to this time, had not felt really ill, only uncomfortable. 

He had a fairly comfortable day Wednesday, but on Wednesday night there was trouble with congestion of the right lung, though the inflammation was confined to the left lung. In fact, at no time during the progress of the disease did the inflammation extend beyond the font part of the left lung. There was, however, a great deal of congestion, and from this time on there was a constant fight against congestion. 

Wednesday night was troubled, and on Thursday morning it was seen that Mr. Warren was very dangerously ill. He was very much prostrated. His mind was occasionally obscured. He looked at times during the day as if he could not survive more than a few hours. But the grim fight went on. The dread congestion would be fought back, would come again suddenly, would be controlled by treatment, and would again and again return. The whole fight was against congestion. Every reasonable device that medical skill could suggest and money procure was brought into requisition. This was the critical time in the disease, and finally, towards night of Thursday, it looked as if death had been beaten back; at least there was more room for hope than there had been at any time since the severity of the disease became apparent. Mr. Warren felt considerably relieved. He was breathing better, his lungs were mere free than they had been for 24 hours. The congestion seemed to be conquered. 

Then came the struggle for life, with all the poison of the disease upon one side and a weak vitality upon the other. It was a question of vitality now, of power to shake off death’s clutches, and the vitality was fearfully low. 

The struggle continued until 8 o’clock Friday morning, when a change came; it was the beginning of the end. The nervous system became disturbed, there was general nervous failure, the system did not respond to stimulants. With the general failure came a return of the congestion, and it could not be removed. The patient could not be rallied. The vitality was too low. It very soon became apparent that the congestion could not be removed and that the fatal time was approaching. Mr. Warren’s consciousness was obscured from the moment the change came, becoming more and more obscured as his life ebbed away. There was very little suffering. From 4 0’clock he was gradually wearing out. He died at 9 o’clock on Friday morning, his unconsciousness merging painlessly and almost imperceptibly into death. 

It was not an instance of severe pneumonia. Hundreds have recovered from an attack quite as severe, but in Mr. Warren’s case the disease came at an unfortunate time, when he was tired out, and had little reserve force.

One remarkable thing much noticed by those about his bedside was his unfailing kindness and thoughtfulness for them, even when he was in extremis. Many women act so in sickness, but men rarely. Men are wont to be impatient, petulant, when confined to a sickbed; women are gentler, more patient. The sweetness of Mr. Warren’s nature was with him to the end. He was kind, thoughtful, grateful for attentions, and was cheerful, hopeful and courageous in all the conscious hours of his sickness. The attending physician said he had never seen a man in extremity bear himself with so much gentleness and consideration for those about him. 

And in this, those who knew him best, know as he died as he had lived, for no one had warmer sympathies or kinder heart. 

WILL CLOSE AT NOON. 

Owing to the funeral of Mr. Warren, the office of the Buffalo Natural Gas Fuel Company, of which he was vice-president, will close at noon on Monday. 

ACTION OF THE MERCHANTS’ EXCHANGE. 

A meeting of the Merchants’ Exchange was called for noon today to take action on the death of Mr. Warren. Amongst those present were:  

President Scatcherd, Vice-president W. C. Newman, George Urban, Jr., George E. Matthews, General P. C. Doyle, Norman E. Mack, Conway W. Ball, Edward W. Eames, George Sandrock, G. H. Wolcott, Leonard Dodge, N.C. Simons, S. S. Brown, P. A. Rosseel, Daniel E. Newhall, Frederick Truscott, Charles F. Sternberg, Alanson Morse, Riley E. Pratt, Thomas J. O’Brien, Francis E Shepherd, F. J. Sawyer, Sidney H. Finn, Willis C. Jacus, Harris Fesbinder, James Devine, William F. O’Roorke, Wm. G. Heathfield, &c., &c.  

The unusual hush over the Exchange prior to the meeting showed how deep and general was the sympathy with the departed member’s family and the grief for the loss of an old member of the body. When President Scatcherd called the meeting to order there was a very large attendance. He said: 

“Gentlemen. It becomes my painful duty today to announce the death of Orsamus G. Warren, born July 21st, 1846, died May 6th, 1892. In accordance with the custom of the Exchange I have ordered a committee to draw up resolutions upon the death of Mr. Warren. That committee consisted of Norman E. Mack, E. H. Butler, George Bleistein, and George E. Matthews. I will now ask Mr. Matthews to read the resolution:  

Mr. Matthews said he desired, on the part of the committee, to submit the following memorial and resolution: 

“In the death of Orsamus G. Warren the Merchants’ Exchange loses a member who was ever alert to the importance of organized effort, and ever ready by word and deed to assist in everything tending to the upbuilding of our local institutions and the onward march of Buffalo as a great and growing commercial center. 

His death is a loss to the city at large because of his eminent respectability in public and private life; his high standing as the head of a newspaper whose influence for good is known and respected in all sections of the state and country. 

To his family, relatives and associates in business we extend our deepest sympathies, assuring them that we share the sorrow and bear in part this burden of grief, a grief which is felt throughout the city and state. All who knew him regret the sudden call and summons which removed him from the busy field of labor and honest endeavor to the reward he so justly earned and so faithfully strove for. 

Resolved, That this memorial minute be spread upon the minutes and a copy signed by the President, Secretary and members of the committee be forwarded to the widow of our late beloved friend and associate. 

NORMAN E. MACK, 

E. H. BUTLER, 

GEO. BLEISTEIN, 

GEO. E. MATTHEWS, Committee. 

The memorial and, resolution were agreed to and the meeting terminated. 

Resolutions by the Republican Committee. 

It was not a very cheerful gathering in the Republican committee rooms this afternoon, when the Republican Executive Committee—political comrades of O. G. Warren—met to take action upon his death. It was a sad task. 

George Urban presided. A motion was carried that Messrs. R. R. Hefford, Harvey J. Hurd, Ossian Bedell and William B. Sirret be appointed a committee with Chairman Urban to  wdraw up appropriate resolutions. The following resolutions were reported and adopted: 

The Republican Executive Committee, in special meeting assembled, while mournfully bowing to the Almighty decree which has removed from us our late esteemed and much beloved friend and leader, O. G. Warren, desire to pay a last tribute of respect to his ability as a leader, his loyalty to and sturdy support of republican principles, worth as a man. 

Twice within recent years the republican party of Erie county has been called upon to mourn the loss of trusted leaders. In 1886 James D. Warren, for years the recognized and successful head of the party in Western New York, laid down the sceptre, which by common consent, was taken up by his son Orsamus G., who has skilfully wielded it for the past six years. 

In the death of O. G. Warren the party loses a leader of sterling worth and rare ability for organization, an excellent judge of human nature, and a man of unlimited energy. Although giving to politics much thought and effort, it was not in the hope of personal advancement or profit. His was an unselfish devotion to the principles of the party he had espoused. Never seeking office or pecuniary reward, he labored for Republican success with a zeal that knew no bounds. 

O. G. Warren was peculiarly a man of the people, always approachable, and recognizing worth when hidden under the garb of a working man as readily as when clothed in broadcloth, and hundreds of the republican rank and file mourn his loss today with unfeigned sorrow, because of valuable services rendered. 

In his loyalty to friends he was stalwart and true, many times suffering undeserved criticism and condemnation, because of his steadfast, unswerving adherence to friends with whom he was associated. 

Resolved, That in the death of O. G. Warren the members of this Committee feel that they have lost a near, dear and sturdy friend; the party, an energetic, skillful and unselfish leader; that an earnest and powerful advocate and defender of republican principles and sound republican doctrine has fallen by the way; that the community has lost a valued member and humanity a whole-souled, manly man. 

Resolved, That this Committee on behalf of the Republican party of Western New York extend to the widow and bereaved family our heartfelt sympathy and condolence in this hour of their terrible affliction, and hope that they may be sustained and comforted by higher than human power. 

Resolved, That an engrossed copy of these resolutions be transmitted to the widow of the deceased, that, as an outward evidence of the sorrow that fills our hearts, these rooms he properly draped in mourning, and that this committee attend the funeral in a body. 

Walter J. Shepard, Thomas T. Ramsdell and William B. Sirret spoke, and paid most feeling and eloquent tributes to the memory of Mr. Warren. 

FROM MR. BAILEY. RICHFIELD SPRINGS, N.Y., May 7. 

William C. Warren, COMMERCIAL, Buffalo: 

It adds to the pangs of a painful illness which banishes me here that I cannot be at the funeral on Monday, but if I cannot see your brother's still face can I remember it never unresponsive to me. 

E. PRENTISS BAILEY. 

FROM MR. HENDRICKS. SYRACUSE, N. Y., May 7. 

Wm. C. Warren, Buffalo: 

I desire to express my sincere sympathy with yourself and the family of Mr. Warren in your great bereavement. 

FRANCIS HENDRICKS. 

From the Elmira Advertiser. 

The regret and sorrow with which the journalistic fraternity of New York learn of the death of Mr. Warren of the BUFFALO COMMERCIAL cannot be overestimated. Although not an editor he was one of the best and best known newspaper men in the state. He came to his work by inheritance after a long training under his able and lamented father, the late James D. Warren. He followed wisely and well in the paternal footsteps and developed executive ability and wisdom in journalism which had few equals in the state. 

Mr. Warren's personal qualities were of the highest order and his friends were numbered by the number of those who were thrown in contact with him. He was modest, genial, considerate, independent, honest, brave and frank. No one ever doubted his word or failed to rely upon his promises. Naturally, then, being deeply interested in politics, he grew to be a power in the Republican party of Western New York. The mantle of his noble father fell upon him in this regard and the trust was well fulfilled. The COMMERCIAL, under his guidance, was the exponent of the best Republican sentiment as it was a representative of the highest standards of able, clean, helpful and elevating journalism. His service to his party was not limited to the influence of his newspaper, but his work in county and state committees was of the greatest benefit. 

The members of the New York State Associated Press especially feel a sense of personal less in Mr. Warren’s death. For many years he served as one of the executive committee of the association and two years ago he was unanimously elected to the presidency of that body. It was during his term of office that several of the great improvements made in the matter and manner of news service were instituted. The writer of this inadequate tribute to Mr. Warren's character, ability and service to the people of the State speaks with the knowledge that comes from life-long acquaintance with him. They were born in the same little village of Erie county and their boyhood training was gained in the same school. In later years their relations with each other in journalism, in the republican state committee and in the associated press have increased and strengthened the appreciation which the writer, long ago, had reason to feel of the noble, personal qualities of Orsamus G. Warren. 

From the Newburg Journal. 

Mr. O. G. Warren, senior proprietor of the BUFFALO COMMERCIAL, died this morning after a short illness, in his forty-sixth year. By his death the newspaper press of the State loses one of its ablest, most alert and energetic members, and the Republican party one of its devoted and hard-working adherents. Mr. Warren has long been a member of the Associated Press of the State of New York, was at one time its President, and ever since he became a member has been influential in its councils. The vacancy caused by his death will not easily be filled. As a Republican Mr. Warren wielded a wide influence in the party in the Western part of the State. 

Utica Herald. 

In every relation of life Mr. Warren won and held the liking and confidence of the men with whom he came in contact. He was always sincere, true to his convictions and steadfast in the purposes to which his judgment or pledges committed him. The death of such a man is a public loss. In the newspaper offices of the State a sense of personal bereavement is experienced, for Mr. Warren's active part in the administration of affairs of the Associated Press made his name as familiar as that of an immediate associate. Sympathies of a host of sincere friends will go out to the loving and most interesting home circle, on which this unutterable grief has fallen with stunning suddenness. 

Brooklyn Eagle. 

Orsaimus G. Warren, leading proprietor of the BUFFALO COMMERCIAL, is dead. He was a son of James D, Warren, long time the owner and conductor of that excellent republican newspaper, and he resembled his honored father in many respects. The sad event occurred this morning. It is a complete surprise to many press and personal friends. Mr. O. G. Warren made his summer home at Shelter Island. Many Brooklynites there learned to know and like him well. He was a thorough journalist, a fair partisan, an influential member of his party’s state committee and an excellent and able man in every personal, civic and business relation. 

Watertown Times. 

In the death of O.G. Warren, of the BUFFALO COMMERCIAL, the state press has lost one of its most valuable members. He was an active, live publisher, young and enthusiastic, and not only made his own newspaper a great success but he was an inspiration to the newspaper press of the state. He was the most active, moving force in the state associated press and last year was its president. Every newspaper office in the state will feel that it has meta personal loss in his death. Mr.Warren like his father, James D. Warren, was active and influential in local and state politics. No young man in this state will be more missed. He had the largest circle of acquaintances, and every one felt a personal friendship for him because he was a genial, pleasant friend to all. He had rare executive talents, and in whatever engaged, in business or political affairs, he was a leader whose advice was always listened to, and an organizer who never failed of success. 

From the Syracuse Courier. 

In the death of O. G. Warren of the Buffalo COMMERCIAL Buffalo loses one of her most prominent and influential citizens, and journalism one of its ablest and most respected members. He was energetic and active, and a most valuable and influential official. A genial and courteous gentleman, he was highly esteemed by all who knew him, and his friends throughout the state were legion. He was a man of pronounced opinions and a stalwart Republican, and his paper was under his able management a model journal. 

Utica Press. 

Yesterday O. G. Warren died at his home in the city of Buffalo, after a brief illness. In politics he was a republican and was one of that party’s active men in this state. The deceased was a man of first-class ability and was successful in whatever he undertook. By those who knew him personally, he was highly esteemed and many have benefited by his substantial favors. His death will be sincerely regretted throughout the state. 

From the Jamestown News. 

Mr. Warren was a republican of the intense school. In his family and social relations Mr. Warren was an hospitable and agreeable gentleman, and one who enjoyed the respect and confidence of a large circle of friends. The journalism of Buffalo is a distinct loser by his death. 

From the Syracuse Standard. 

New York State journalism is in mourning today for a man who carried into it enthusiasm and brilliancy. O. G. Warren, editor of the BUFFALO COMMERCIAL, was a man of superior attainments and honest impulses. His death is an untoward event, the poignancy of which can be measured only by those who were most intimate with him in his work and in his leisure.
