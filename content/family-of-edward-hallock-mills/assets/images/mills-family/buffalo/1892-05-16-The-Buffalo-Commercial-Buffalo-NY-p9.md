IN MEMORY OF THE DEAD. 

Business Associates of the Late O. G. Warren Take Action Upon His Death. 

A meeting of the directors of Bellevue Land and Improvement company was held at 11 o’clock this morning at the office of President Henry W. Box. 

The directors present were Henry W. Box, Daniel O’Day, Joan Satterfield, John N. Scatcherd, Henry M. Watson, William Hengerer, James A. Roberts, H. H. Littell, John C. Conway and S. S. Spaulding. 

George Urban, Jr., a stockholder, was also present. Charles A. Sweet, a member of the board of directors, was absent on account of sickness. 

James A. Roberts offered a touching memorial upon the death of O. G. Warren, who was one of the projectors of the organization, a director, and a member of a committee intrusted with the sale of lands. Messrs. Box and Sweet were the other members of the committee. The memorial was as follows. 

Since our last meeting, an honored member of this Board has died, and it seems fitting at this time that some expression of our appreciation of his work and worth should be made. To very few men have been given the somewhat opposite business qualities of fertility in resource and method in details. We can readily recall many instances of men full of suggestions and ways for promoting great business results, and who when the time comes, as it must in all enterprises, for patience, method and exactness, are worse than useless. On the other hand the world is full of men who can do nothing except follow the details of plans which others have made. Mr. Warren possessed in a highly Successful degree both of the qualities of fertility and exactness. No man with whom we have ever been associated had more abundant reliable resources at his command. His suggestions were never inapt but always practical and worthy of careful consideration. Those of us who were active in the formation of our Bellevue enterprise know the very great debt we owe Mr. Warren for his valuable suggestions. Even the name we bear came from him. In working out the details of any business he was the soul of patience, method and exactness. He was a man moreover to whom any one of us would have readily entrusted our all in the full assurance that to the uttermost farthing right would be done. As a companion he was always pleasant, lively, responsive and considerate. 

Prompt, alert, resourceful, exact, honorable, agreeable, quick and clear of comprehension, he was an ideal member of any business board. 

Resolved, In testimony of our high respect and appreciation of Mr. Warren and of his work for our company, this simple statement be inscribed in our minutes. 

Several of those present spoke in feeling terms of Mr. Warren, expressing profound regret at his untimely death. 

Then, on motion of Mr. Littell, seconded by Mr. Watson, the vacancy on the board of directors caused by Mr. Warren’s death was filled by the election of Mr. Urban. 

ACTION OF THE DEPEW LAND AND IMPROVEMENT COMPANY. 

At a meeting of the officers and directors of the Depew Land and Improvement Company, held this afternoon, the following resolutions on the death of Mr. Warren, were adopted: 

Resolved, That in the death of Orsamus G. Warren Buffalo loses an estimable and popular citizen, one who labored unceasingly to increase its prosperity and extend its reputation, and the Depew Land and Improvement Company its Vice-President, a valued counselor and a wise director in all its affairs, and we, its officers, a loyal, generous friend, whose sudden death we feel as a personal bereavement, and we extend to the heart-stricken family our tenderest sympathy. 

Resolved, That the foregoing resolution be placed upon the minutes of the company and the secretary be instructed to furnish the family with an engrossed copy. 

In speaking to the resolutions Mr. Henry W. Box paid the following touching and eloquent tribute to the memory of his friend: 

If I obeyed the monitions of a deeply afflicted soul I should be silent upon the resolution just offered on the death of my dear friend Warren. Such generous and loving tributes have been paid to his memory by the entire press of the state and by the varied interests with which he was associated and so important in life, that it is very difficult to speak anything new of his living actions. 

Nothing is needed to keep his honor bright. One who enjoyed Mr. Warren’s friendship from early boyhood to his death, has so completely expressed my own estimate of the man, that I will read a paragraph from his editorial: “Blameless in his private life, in public he was distinguished by all the honors which a host of devoted friends and followers could induce him to accept. Successful and prosperous, with all that man desires most at his command, his sudden and untimely taking off is a calamity which comes with crushing force upon those to whom he was most near and dear.” 

“In The midst of life we are in death.” Never was this saying more strikingly and sadly illustrated. Like a falling star he passes from the familiar scenes to be forevermore with the silent. Within one short week our dear friend, full of life and vigor of mind and body, in.the prime of manhood and usefulness is cut off. 

<pre>
“The glories of our birth and state 
    Are shadows, not substantial things; 
There is no armor against fate, 
    Death lays his icy hand on kings. 
<br/>
“Sceptre and crown
Must tumble down, 
And in the dust be equal made 
With the poor crooked scythe and spade.” 
</pre>

The directors of this company enjoyed an intimate personal acquaintance with Mr. Warren. We knew his manly and amiable character, and valued him for his sterling worth in his business relations. 

Whatever he did was done thoroughly; always alert, enterprising and straightforward. In every relation of life Mr. Warren won and held the friendship and confidence of the men with whom he came into contact. He was always sincere, true to his convictions, and steadfast in the purposes to which his judgment committed him. Mr. Warren, at the death of his honored father, was placed in a most critical position as the director of a great newspaper property and the undisputed leader of the republican party. How well he executed the trusts confided to him we ail know. 

It is not always an advantage to be the son of a distinguished father. It is common for the merits of the son to suffer injustice by comparison, but our friend was a man of uncommon intensity of purpose; his individuality was so strong that he needed no reflected light to make him a leader of men and a sagacious business man. 

If our lives here are to be measured by actions, by achievements and not by figures on a dial, then the life of our friend was full. He had acquired in early manhood that which the poet considered the chief blessings of old age—wealth, honor and troops of friends. 

A very close newspaper friend of Mr. Warren, speaking of his death says: “A career of eminent public and private usefulness, marked by honorable achievements has been brought to a sudden and untimely end.” 

“One who was genial in all his relations with associates, staunch in his friendship and upright and true in all his dealings. 

“To have done so much, to have filled spheres so important and varied and filled them so well, and before reaching his forty-sixth birthday, forms a record that will prove a blessed heritage to his family. The best of it was that a young heart and strong attachments and open ways went with it all, helped it all, were potent elements of it all, And here is the secret of friendships that bleed today.”
