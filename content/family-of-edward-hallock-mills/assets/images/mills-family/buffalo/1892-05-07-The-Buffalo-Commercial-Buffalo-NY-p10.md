MORE WORDS OF GRIEF 

ON THE DEATH OF MR. O. G. WARREN. 

Action of the East Side Republican League and Other Organizations—The Tribute of the “Commerciai” Employees—The Funeral on Monday. 

ACTION OF “COMMERCIAL” EMPLOYES. 

The employes of the newspaper and book and job printing departments of the Buffalo Commercial held a joint meeting this morning, to take action on the death of their late employer. Mr. George F. Hilbert was elected chairman, and Frank P. Turner secretary. On motion the chair appointed Messrs. Henry W. Dolmage, Jacob Pfohl and Henry E. Hickey a committee on resolutions. The committee presented the following preamble and resolutions, which were unanimously adopted: 

Whereas, Having learned with deep regret of the death of our beloved employer, Orsamus George Warren, we deem it befitting to give expression to our profound sorrow at his untimely demise. 

In the prime of a useful and busy life, with a bright vista before him, the sudden parting of the golden chain of affection that bound us all so closely to him is but another exemplification of the mysterious ways of Providence. It seems but yesterday that we rejoiced in the sunlight of his presence: today we mourn in the inky shadow with which his decease has so suddenly overwhelmed us. 

A just man, an honorable man, he was a noble son of a noble sire. It was a privilege to know him, an honor to be his friend. Of generous, sympathetic nature, he was ever ready to aid by word and deed those who appealed to him for counsel and assistance. Long years of intimate business relations ripened into fraternal regard for him, and his genial, happy disposition will leave a lasting impress upon us whose good fortune it was to serve him. 

In the death of Mr. Warren we have lost a true friend and a kind employer, our appreciation of whose qualities of head and heart we cannot adequately express in words, therefore, be it 

Resolved, that we sincerely mourn his sudden departure from the scene of his earthly labors, cut down in the prime of vigorous life. 

Resolved, That to the bereaved family whom he so dearly loved and whose welfare he so constantly watched, we tender our heartfelt sympathy and condolence, and humbly invoke for them the guardianship of Him who orders all things well. 

Resolved, That a copy of this preamble and these resolutions be engrossed and presented to the family of our deceased friend as a token of our sincere regard for him, and a memento of our sympathy for those whom he held most dear. 

ACTION OF SAVINGS BANE TRUSTEES. 

The Board of Trustees of the Buffalo Savings Bank at a special meeting this forenoon, called to take action upon the death of Orsamus G. Warren, adopted the following memorial: 

A few months ago in seeking among the citizens of Buffalo for one who could worthily fill the place made vacant by the resignation of a valued member of this Board, our choice fell upon Orsamus G. Warren. 

Although he has been associated with us but a short time, we have learned to recognize in him those qualities of mind and character which made him a successful business man, and which enabled him to achieve for himself an honerable position in this community and in the State. 

Actively engaged in political life, his record has been without blemish: at the head of one of the leading daily journals of the country he has kept its columns eminently pure and wholesome, and, under his supervision its utterances have ever been outspoken in the cause of morality and good government. 

He was a conspicuous public man, called by his party and his business associates to high office and places of trust, he always acquitted himself with honor and credit.  

Recognizing in him these characteristics which singularly fitted him for a position of responsibility he was elected a member of this Board last December, in the reasonable hope that the institution committed to our care would have the benefit of his sagacious counsel long after the older members of the Board should have passed away. 

This hope was in vain; in the prime of life; in the vigor of early manhood, and seemingly at the threshold of his greatest usefulness, Orsamus G. Warren has suddenly been summoned from our councils. 

In his death we mourn with the city at large the loss of one who had her best interests at heart and who was active in promoting her growth and prosperity. 

We extend to his friends and business associates our sympathy in the loss they have sustained; and we desire to express to the members of his family our profound grief at the bereavement which has cast its dark shadow over their home. 

In recognition of his worth, and as a lasting testimony to our sorrow, we direct this memorial to be entered upon the minutes of the Board. 

ACTION OF THE EAST SIDE LEAGUE. 

The East Side Republican League adopted the following resolutions last night: 

Resolved, That from an earnest desire to show every mark of respect to the memory of Orsamus G. Warren, late leader of the Republican party of Erie county, and to manifest the high estimate entertained of his eminent services to the Republican party, his distinguished patriotism and his usefulness as a citizen, the business of the East Side Republican League be now suspended, that the friends and associates of deceased may pay fitting tribute to his public and private virtues. 

Resolved, That a widespread and public sorrow on the announcement of his death attested the profound sense of the loss which the whole community has sustained. 

Resolved, That as a mark of respect for the memory of Mr. Orsamus G. Warren, the members of the East Side Republican League do now adjourn.
