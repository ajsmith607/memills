  - From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantilla): "A mantilla is a traditional Spanish and Latin American liturgical lace or silk veil or shawl worn over the head and shoulders, often over a high comb called a peineta, popular with women in Spain, as well as in Latin America. It is also worn by Traditional Catholic and Plymouth Brethren women in various parts of the globe, Mennonite women in Argentina, and without the peineta by Eastern Orthodox women in Russia, often white, with the ends crossed over neck and draped over the opposite shoulder. For these denominations, the mantilla is worn as a Christian headcovering by women during church services, as well as during special occasions. A smaller version of the mantilla is called a toquilla."

Decidedly Interesting.—The people will find, by calling at Hamlin & Mendsen’s dry goods store, on Thursday, April 30tb, and following days, over sixty thousand dollars worth of dress goods and dress silks, (all new styles) at prices from 50 to 100 per cent. below the cost of importation, just bought in New York, with cash, at the great break-down auction sales. 

Everybody is requested to call and see the goods, without feeling under the least obligation to purchase. Should they, however, find the temptation to buy irresistible on seeing the goods and prices, they ought not to blame the proprietors. 

At the same time, new novelties in spring cloaks and mantillas can be seen. Also, a large and desirable lot of wall papers and carpets.
