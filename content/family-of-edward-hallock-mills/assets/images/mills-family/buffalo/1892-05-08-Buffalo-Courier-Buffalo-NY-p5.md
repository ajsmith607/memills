HEARTFELT TRIBUTES.

Expressions of General Sorrow for Mr. Warren's Death.

Press Club Meeting to Voice the Sentiment of the Newspaper Workers — Action of the Merchants’ Exchange and Other Organizations. 

In response to a call issued by President Charles F. Kingsley of the Press Club, a large number of active members of the press of Buffalo assembled at the club rooms yesterday afternoon to give expression to the professional sentiment regarding the lamented death of the senior proprietor and editor of the *Commercial*, Orsamus G. Warren. 

President Kingsley stated the purpose of the gathering in a few remarks, in which he alluded to the universal feeling among the newspaper men of the city that they had lost a true friend and one whose character and accomplishments were such as had done honor to journalism.

Mark Bennett, editor of the *Times*, Charles A, White of the *News*, and George Ferris of the *Courier*, were appointed as a committee on resolutions: 

George E. Matthews, proprietor of the *Express*, spoke of the life and death of his early and long-time friend, Mr. Warren, with manifestly deep feeling. There could be no more sincere tribute to the virtues, talents and kindness of heart of the deceased gentleman.

Edwin Fleming, the editor of the COURIER, also addressed the meeting feelingly, saying he had known Mr. Warren as a frank, straight-forward, sagacious man of uncommonly tenacious purpose, optimistic as such tenacious men are apt to be, cheerful, full of hopefulness, always courteous and cordial. No partisan newspaper controversy was so spirited or violent as to dull this courtesy, this cordiality. It was especially fitting that the newspaper workers should gather to pay tribute to one who had so many sterling qualities of head and heart.

Norman E. Mack, proprietor of the *Times*, paid tribute to Mr. Warren as a loyal friend and useful citizen, whose death was a public misfortune. 

The committee then submitted their report, as follows: 

The Buffalo Press Club had hoped to be spared for many years the record of death which this day compels. 

Orsamus G. Warren’s great activity and well balanced energies conveyed the constant assurance of many added years of usefulness of successes further to bless, his family and all with whom associations could not fail to benefit. 

This Club speaks with gratitude of Mr. Warren's active relations with this fraternity and in appreciation of his abiding interest and thoughtfulness for its well-being. He was proud of the newspaper as an institution and was zealous in advancing its standard and promoting its influence for good. His advice to those with whom he was associated was ever a counseling to better endeavor. His friendship was something to be highly prized and sacredly preserved. His qualities of mind and heart were understood only to be admired. The impress of his example will be one of enduring force  upon the press of this city and State.

Words are indeed inadequate to express the emotions of sorrow that we feel or the deep sympathy we have for those who were nearest to him in the holy relations of the home. We have lost a good friend and safe adviser and his memory we shall ever revere.

It is directed that this tribute be spread-upon the records of this club and that copies hereof be sent to Mr. Warren's family and to the newspapers of Buffalo.  

Arthur W,. Austin, city editor of the *Commercial*, on behalf of the staff of that paper, spoke a beautifully worded and effective eulogium of their departed chief, after which the resolutions were adopted. 

Action of the Merchants’ Exchange. 

The prominent business men of Buffalo were largely represented at a special meeting held on ’Change yesterday at noon. President J. N. Scateherd presided, A committee consisting of Norman E. Mack, E. H. Butler, George E. Matthews and George Bleistein, had been previously appointed by him to draft a memorial for Mr. Warren. Their report, presented by Mr. Matthews and unanimously adopted, spoke of the deceased as  “a member who was ever alive to the importance of organized effort, and ever ready by word and deed to assist in everything tending to the upbuilding of our local institutions and the onward march of Buffalo as a great and growing commercial center.”

Action of Buffalo Savings Bank Trustees. 

The Board of Trustees of the Buffalo Sayings Bank at a special meeting yesterday forenoon, called to take action upon the death of Orsamus G. Warren, adopted the following memorial: 

A few months ago in seeking among the citizens of Buffalo for one who could worthily fill the place made vacant by the resignation of a valued member of this Board, our choice fell upon Osamus G. Warren.

Although he has been associated with us but a short time, we have learned to recognize in him those qualities of mind and character which made him a successful business man, and which enabled him to achieve for himself an honorable position in this community and in the State.

Actively engaged in political life, his record has been without blemish; at the head of one of the leading daily journals of the country, he has kept its columns eminently pure and wholesome, and under his supervision its utterances have ever been outspoken in the cause of morality and good government.

He was a conspicuous public man, called by his party and his business associates to high office and places of trust, he always acquitted himself with honor and credit.

Recognizing in him those characteristics which singularly fitted him for a position of responsibility, he was elected a member of this Board last December, in the reasonable hope that the institution committed to our care would have the benefit of his sagacious counsel long after the older members of the Board should have passed away.

This hope was in vain; in the prime of life, in the vigor of early manhood, and seemingly at the threshold of his greatest usefulness, Orsamus G. Warren has suddenly been summoned from our councils.

In his death we mourn with the city at large the loss of one who had her best interest at heart and who was active in promoting her growth and prosperity.

We extend to his friends and business associates our sympathy in the loss they have sustained; and we desire to express to the members of his family our profound grief at the bereavement which has cast its dark shadow over their home.

In recognition of his worth, and as a lasting testimony to our sorrow, we direct this memorial to be entered upon the minutes of the Board.

Action of the Republican Committee. 

George Urban presided at a meeting of the Republican Executive Committee yesterday afternoon. R. R. Hefford, Harvey J. Hurd, and Ossian Dedell as a committee submitted memorial resolutions. These set forth that in the death of Mr. Warren the party lost a leader of sterling worth and rare ability for organization, an excellent judge of human nature, and a man of unlimited energy. Although giving to politics much thought and effort, it was not in the hope of personal advancement or profit. He was peculiarly a man of the people, always approachable, and recognizing worth when hidden under the garb of a workingman as readily as when clothed in broadcloth.

Eloquent tributes to Mr. Warren’s worth were given by Walter J. Shepard, Thomas T. Ramsdell, and William B. Sirret.

Action of the Republican League.

A meeting of the Republican League last evening was largely attended, President Scatcherd in the chair. George S. Howe, E. C. Volger, and C. K. Robinson were appointed a committee on resolutions relative to the death of Mr. Warren. The memorial which they reported was adopted after feeling and affecting remarks by Judge E. W. Hatch, the Hon. Arthur W. Hickman, Martin Clark, and N. S. Rosenau.
