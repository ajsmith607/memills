BESIDE HIS FATHER.  

MR. WARREN'S BODY LAID AT REST. 

Simple Funeral Ceremonies Attended by a Great Throng—Well-known People Who Were Present—More Resolutions Adopted in Tribute to the Dead. 

It was no common grief that wrung the hearts of the hundreds that went one by one to O. G. Warren’s bier yesterday afternoon and took their last, lingering look at the face of the dead. Tears dimmed many eyes that looked on that still form, which only a few days ago was instinct with bounding life. 

The simplicity of the funeral was in strict accord with the simplicity of Mr. Warren’s nature. He would have had just such a funeral for his dearest friend. Only the Most simple ceremonies were held—a prayer or two, reading of a chapter from the Scriptures, and then the bearers took up their burden. 

There was a great throng present. The large house was full to overflowing, and hundreds stood outside. On every side could be seen men prominent in the professional, official, business and social life of Buffalo. Among those noticed in the throng were the following: 

Mayor Bishop, Postmaster Gentsch, ex-Mayor Becker, R. R. Hefford, Assemblyman Clark, Pension-Agent Schenkelberger, Deputy County Clerk Daniel H. Turner, ex-Senator John Laughlin, Peter A. Vogt, County Treasurer John B. Sackett, Commissioners of Public Works George S. Gatchell and James Mooney, Augustus F. Scheu, County Judge Seaver, ex-Ald. McMaster, Councilman George W. Hayward, Harlan J. Swift, C. M. Bushnell, Charles H. Avery, George Gorham, ex-City Chemist Frank P. Vandenbergh, Tracy C. Becker, Dr. Stockton, Assemblyman Gallagher, Judge Wardwell, Thomas Cary, the Hon. George A. Lewis, Dr. Fowler, Dr. E. C. W. O’Brien, Dr. Samuel G. Dorr, Peter J. Ferris, Henry Altman, William B. Hoyt, Ald. Scheu, Col. John B. Weber, Joseph P. Dudley, S. O. Barnum, Fire Commissioner Zeller, Jacob F. Schoellkopf, George E. Laverack, George P. Sawyer, C. M. Farrar, W. C. Newman, Judge Hatch, Councilman Baldus, John McManus, Albert White, Assistant Postmaster Wheeler, Charles A. Orr, Col. John Byrne, City Auditor Smith, Peter P. Miller, Charles G. Irish, D. J. Kenetick, William H. Cottier, William E. Clark, William A. Bird, Herbert P. Bissell, Corporation Counsel Browne, George M. Stowe, C. L. Abell, John W. Fisher. Geo. Bleistein, Edwin Fleming, Ottomar Reinecke, C. E. Austin, Assistant Police Supt. Cusack, Assessor Crowley. 

The Republican League, Cleveland Democracy, Veteran Legion, Republican County Committee, Press Club, Merchants’ Exchange and other organizations were represented. 

Among prominent out-of-town people present were the following: Senator Frank Hiscock, ex-State Senator J. Sloat Fassett; the Hon. George W. Aldrich and L. Ward Clarke of Rochester, Carroll E. Smith, Syracuse Journal; D. T. Hunt, Rochester Post-Express; J. B. Platt, Poughkeepsie Eagle; E. W. Hackett, Utica Herald; W. F. Ealkam, Rochester Union and Advertiser; Col. N. P. Pond and W. H. Matthews, Rochester Democrat and Chronicle; W. A. Cobb and J. A. Ward, Lockport Journal; M. H. Northrup, Syracuse Courier; John H. Cunningham, Utica Herald; Charles S. Francis, Troy Times; R. R. Soper, Elmira Gazette; E. L. Adams, Elmira Advertiser; O. W. Cutler, Lockport Union; Adam Renewalt, Amherst Bee; J. B. Miller, Hamburg Independent; Mr. and Mrs. Edward P. Hamilton of Grange, N. J. 

In obedience to the desire of the family, sympathy was not manifested in floral offerings. A great mass of flowers almost buried the casket, but they came from the immediate relatives. 

The body was in a parlor to the right of the entrance, and here place was made for the COMMERCIAL staff—close to all that was mortal of the man who had been very close to them in life, their wisest adviser and best friend.  

The Rev. Dr. S. S. Mitchell of the First Presbyterian church offered prayer, and the Rev. T. Ralston Smith of Westminster Presbyterian church read from the Scriptures. Then came another prayer, and after that the sad precession to the grave. Only the relatives, pall-bearers, Commercial staff, the Associated Press delegation, and a few others from out of town accompanied the body to the cemetery. 

The pall-bearers were as follows: 

HONORARY BEARERS. 

Gen. R. L. Howard, John L. Williams, Robert Keating, William E. Foster, Hon. D. H. McMillan, Hon. Benj. H. Williams, Hon. Albert Haight, Wilson S. Bissell. 

BEARERS. 

George Urban, Jr., Hon. James A. Roberts. Frank M. Hollister, John N. Scatcherd, Hon. Harvey J. Hurd, William J. Morgan, George T. Quinby, Peter P. Bartis. 

At the grave, which was placed close to that of Mr. Warren’s honored father in Forest Lawn, Dr. Mitchell held a brief committal service and all was over. 

TRIBUTES TO THE DEAD. 

The executive committee of the Union Veteran Legion met last evening and adopted the following resolution: 

Resolved, That in common with the people of this county, irrespective of political affiliations, this committee mourn the loss by death of Mr. Orsamus G. Warren, for many years an honorary member of this Legion, a public spirited citizen, a steadfast friend of our city’s best interests, and a man stalwart in his political convictions. 

Resolved, That we herewith tender our condolence to his bereaved family, and that a copy of these resolutions, properly indorsed, be forwarded to them. 

The Cleveland Democracy adopted the following last evening: 

Resolved, That the Cleveland Democracy joins in the general grief of our citizens at the death of O. G. Warren. Although opposed to us in politics, he was always fair, considerate, and mindful of the demands of honorable political warfare; and we therefore held him in high esteem. By his death many of us mourn a warm personal friend, and the City of Buffalo mourns the loss of an enterprising and public-spirited citizen; therefore, 

Resolved, That we hereby tender to the bereaved family our deep sympathy and that these resolutions be spread upon the minutes of this organization and a copy thereof sent to the family of the deceased. 

The Democratic. County Committee adopted the following resolution: 

The Democratic County Committee of Erie Ceunty have learned, with feelings of deep sorrow, of the death of Orsamus G. Warren, editor of the COMMERCIAL, and long the Republican leader in this county, and deem it fit and proper that they place upon record their respect for the lamented dead. 

Resolved, That in the death of Orsamus G. Warren the city of Buffalo has lost one of its most enterprising and popular citizens, and one who was ever alive to its best interests. 

Resolved, That to the bereaved and stricken widow and fatherless children we tender our sincerest sympathies in this hour of sorrow and affliction. 

Resolved, That these resolutions be spread upon the minutes and be published in the daily papers of this city. 

The executive committee of the New York State Associated Press met yesterday at the Iroquois and appointed the following committee to draw up resolutions in memory of Mr. Warren: E. Prentiss Bailey, Carroll E. Smith, R. R. Soper, C. S. Francis, W. A. Cobb, George E. Matthews, George Bleistein, Norman E. Mack, Charles E. Austin and William B. Held. They will report at the next meeting. 

The trial term of the Superior Court was adjourned yesterday by Judge Hatch, on account of the funeral of Mr. Warren. 

From the Cold Spring Journal. 

The writer, whose high privilege it was until the last to be associated with Mr. Warren in newspaper effort, is deeply sensible of the loss sustained of a staunch friend whose amiability and kindly counsel have often been a tower of strength to him in combatting the asperities and harass incident to the profession. But, words altogether failing in this dark hour of mourning, to convey our deep sense of sorrow at the blow which has fallen on the citizens of Buffalo, we can simply tender to the grief stricken family of Mr. Warren and our contemporary the COMMERCIAL, together with the whole of its devoted staff, our sincerest condolences at yesterday’s unhappy event, feeling, in sympathy with them all, that now the worst has happened the only real consolation in future derived will be to affectionately cherish the memory of a good and noble man whose honorable career, cut short, so untimely, shall prove an emulating power, and the truest tribute to which can be paid, is to aim ourselves at approaching the lofty level presented by his bright and enviable example.
