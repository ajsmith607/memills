The portrait of the late Orsamus G Warren, which we publish today, is from a recent photograph by McMichael, and will be widely recognized as a faithful likeness. A detailed sketch of Mr. Warrenâ€™s life appeared in THE EXPRESS yesterday: but because of the greater circulation of THE ILLUSTRATED EXPRESS we republish from yesterday's issue the editorial estimate of Mr. Warren's character, and append the following biographical data: Mr. Orsamus G. Warren died at his home in this city on Friday, the 6th inst. His illness, which was of less than a week's duration, resulted from a severe cold which he took when comings home from the recent Republican State Convention at Albany, and Was diagnosed as lobar pneumonia. 

Mr. Warren was widely known as the successor of his father, the late James D. Warren, as chief proprietor of the Buffalo Commercial, and as a political leader. He was for several years a member of the Republican State Committee and a delegate to State Conventions. He was a delegate from this district to the National Republican Convention of 1888, and had recently been elected a delegate to the Convention of 1892. He was for eight years a member of the Executive Committee of the State Associated Press, and served last year as president of the association, retiring at the annual meeting held last month in New York.
