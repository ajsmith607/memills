Death of Robert Mills.

Robert Mills, ex-Police Commissioner and one of the best known men in Buffalo, died at his residence on Prospect avenue this morning. Mr. Mills suffered a stroke of paralysis several years ago and had been an invalid ever since. He was stricken with a stroke of apoplexy on Monday last and that was the immediate cause of death. Mr. Mills was born in Toronto Nov. 17, 1824. He sailed on the lake vessels for a good many years. In 1855 he stopped sailing and with Patrick Walsh started a shipyard. The firm was remarkably successful and today the firm Mills & Company is known from one end of the great lakes to the other. In politics Mr. Mills was a Republican. Capt. Mills was married to Margaret A. Cherry in 1845. Three children were born to him and they, with his wife, survive him.
