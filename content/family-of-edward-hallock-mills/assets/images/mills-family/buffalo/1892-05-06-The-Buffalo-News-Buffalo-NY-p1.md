O. G. WARREN DEAD 

The Editor of the “Commercial” Died This Morning. 

A PEACEFUL END. 

His Physicians Worked Hard to Save His Life, and Resorted to Heroic Methods Without Avail—A Sketch of His Life. 

Mr. Orsamus G, Warren died this morning at 9:30 o'clock. The end came peace fully, gently, as though it were the growing unconsciousness of a heavy sleep. 

At noon yesterday Mr. Warren's condition was such that all hope of his recovery was practically given up. Yet the physicians in attendance did not cease the unequal battle. They labored untiringly hoping against hope that there was just the barest chance that they might save their patient's life. 

Oxygen was resorted to and pumped into Mr. Warren’s lungs. In spite of this he continued to grow weaker, and late in the afternoon his condition was such that his death was looked upon as a matter of only a few hours. 

At midnight Mr. Warren seemed to revive and the physicians and the family began to hope that his life might yet be spared. But at 3 o'clock another change came, With a gasp, as if seized by the agony of death, he raised his hands feebly and whispered: “Help me!” 

From that moment he became unconscious and sank gradually until 9:15 this morning, when he passed away as if falling asleep. 

His family and the physicians were at the bedside, but the ears of the loving father had for hours been deaf to the sobs of anguish and whispered words of grief and affliction that came from his wife and children. 

It was his first and last serious illness, He had always been an active, robust man, ever ready to do that which would relieve the sufferings of others but knowing little of physical suffering from experience. 

Mr. Warren went to New York the early part of last week on a business mission, and on his way home last Thursday he stopped at Albany to attend the Republican State Convention, to which he was a delegate. At that time he felt tired and overworked, but promised himself a little rest and recuperation on his return home. Nevertheless he took an active part in the proceedings of the convention and remained at Albany until after its adjournment, With the other Buffalo delegates he took the train out of Albany at midnight and arrived in Buffalo early Friday morning. 

He went to his office on Friday, but in the afternoon he was taken with a severe chill, and forced to leave work and go to bed. The symptoms of pneumonia immediately developed. When it was discovered that the illness had taken this turn, the family became greatly alarmed, but the physicians, while considering the case serious, did not admit its hopeless character until yesterday morning. The most approved methods of treatment were tried, including the pumping of oxygen into the lungs, but all without avail. The patient failed to rally. Since the first attack he had been continually sinking, sinking—it was down-hill all the time. His ceaseless activity in business had robbed his constitution of all resistive force. He fell a victim as his father did in December, 1886.  

Orsamus G. Warren was born in the town of Clarence in 1846, and was consequently 46 years of age. He lived and went to school there until 1856, when his father, James D, Warren, was elected County Treasurer, and moved with his family to Buffalo. He then attended School 14 on Franklin street, and later went to the High School, but did not complete his course. He made good use of his opportunities at school and acquired a substantial education. He did not go to college, but on leaving school he entered the office of the *Commercial*, in which paper his father bought an interest on the 9th of April, 1861. 

About the year 1868 the young man took about a year’s vacation and spent the time traveling in Europe with a party of which James N. Matthews was one. A year or so after his return he took an extended Western trip with John Bullymore and others, visiting numerous points in the Rocky Mountain and Sierra Nevada region. The trip lasted several months. 

On his return he settled down in the *Commercial* office, and has been active in its affairs and management ever since. Three or four years before his father’s death he became practically the manager of the concern. The senior Warren still visited the office and gave a general direction to affairs, but to his eldest son he committed all the details and executive work, giving him also an interest in the business. The two sous became the sole owners of the newspaper and printing house on the death of their father, 

O. G, Warren was an excellent business man. He received a thorough education in the counting room from his father. He was systematic and had aptitude, discernment and good judgment. He was a director of the American Exchange Bank, and last year was president of the New York Associated Press.

Though Mr. Warren never held office, and never sought one, he was active in politics and influential in getting places for his friends. He succeeded his father as member of the State Committee from this district and held the place until last fall, when he declined to serve longer, and in his place John N. Scatcherd was elected. Mr. Warren was a delegate to every State convention since his father’s death. While he was on the State Committee he was a member of the Executive Committee. He was a delegate to the National convention of 1888, and a delegate-elect to the convention which is to meet June 7 at Minneapolis. 

He was fond of society and had many warm friends, not only in this city but also throughout the State. 

Mr. Warren leaves a wife who is a daughter of the late John B. Griffin, and four children—one boy and three girls. He is also survived by his only brother, William C. Warren, and by his sisters, Mrs. Isaac Bromley of Hartford. Ct., and Miss Mary Warren of this city. 

Daniel J. Kenefick is Mr. Warren’s alternate, and will therefore be entitled to Mr. Warren's seat in the National Convention.
