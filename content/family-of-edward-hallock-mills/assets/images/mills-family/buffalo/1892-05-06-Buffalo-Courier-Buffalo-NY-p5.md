DANGEROUSLY ILL. 

Orsamus G. Warren Suffering from Pneumonia—His Condition Critical. 

Orsamus G. Warren, the senior proprietor of the *Commercial*, is a very sick man—so ill that only a faint hope for his recovery can be reasonably entertained, and at any moment new announcement of his death could cause no surprise, although it would be a painful shock to this whole community. 

For quite a long time Mr. Warren’s health has not been of the best, but no real cause for anxiety was apparent until a few days ago when he was compelled to remain indoors, becoming worse until on Wednesday his condition was alarming. Yesterday morning he was unconscious, and Dr. Stockton remained with him throughout the day. Drs. Rochester and Cary were called into consultation. 

At 8:30 o’clock last evening, Dr. Jones, also in attendance at the home of the patient on Worth Street, said: 

"Mr. Warren’s illness is the true pneumonia, years ago known as lung fever. After the disease runs five, seven, or nine days, what is known as the crisis is reached, surviving which the patient is likely to recover. This is is Mr. Warren’s sixth day, and every hour that he lives brings him nearer to the crisis and increases his chances of recovery. His condition this evening is practically unchanged since noon, but not as favorable as it was morning.” : 

At 10:15 Mr. Warren’s condition was reported as slightly changed for the better. No marked improvement had occurred since noon, but, all things considered, the physicians felt that there was better grounded to save him.
