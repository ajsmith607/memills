Deborah S. Mills. 

Mrs. Deborah S., widow of Wm. Mills, died last evening, aged 83 years. She was born at Smithtown Branch, Long Island, and married Mr. Mills in 1819. The couple then emigrated to Clarence, this county, up the Hudson to Albany in a sloop, and in their carriage across the State. Mrs. Mills, with her husband, moved to this city in 1865, where, two years later, the latter died. She was a member of the North Church. She leaves six children, Margaret A., John S., Mary, wife of Mr. James D. Warren, Mrs. Martha H. Baker, James H. and Thomas H. Mills. All reside in this city, with the exception of the last-named, who lives at Osco, Nebraska. 

The funeral services will be held at 111 Park street, on Friday at 10 A. M., and the burial will be at Clarence.
