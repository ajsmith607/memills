The Albany *Times* says: 

“JAMES D. Warren is the sturdiest oak left in the stalwart forest. He blows only his very smallest branches to the most angry half-bred blow.  His following in the Republican party is as strong to-day as ever the stalwart throng under Conkling was, in that gentleman’s proud days of leadership, and as compact and faithful as were the 306 of 1880, or The Spartan band of 1881. When Mr. James D. Warren sets about deciding on a senator, the senator he decides upon will get elected or there will  be trouble. Mr. McMillan says he does not know whether Mr. Warren will be a candidate. It is not Mr. Warren's way to go into a candidacy with a brass band or waving of banners. He did not go with any blazonry at all into the convention at Saratoga last year, yet he stood second on the first ballot for Governor with 187 votes.”
