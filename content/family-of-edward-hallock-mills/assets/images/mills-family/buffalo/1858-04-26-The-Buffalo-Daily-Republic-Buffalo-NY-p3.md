Postponed by Particular Request.— The *Express* of this morning states that Judge Mills sentenced Ira Stout, the Rochester murderer, to be hung on the 18th of June—*the anniversary of the battle of Bunker Hill.* As that very unimportant dispute occurred on the *seven teenth* of June, its anniversary has been undoubted been postponed to enable Mr. Stout to make his exit from a world that he has outraged, on a day of glory. 

P. S.—The Cyclopedia of Universal History says the battle took place June 7. We think it should be 17th.
