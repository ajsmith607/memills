The Late Robert Mills. 

At a meeting of the Board of Police yesterday afternoon resolutions were adopted in memory of the late ex-Commissioner Robert Mills, and it was decided to attend the funeral in a body. 

A special meeting of the Buffalo Excelsior Marine Benevolent Association was held last evening. Capt. Alexander Clark presided. After announcement had been made of the death of Capt. Robert Mills, Capt. Clark appointed Capts. Thomas Collins, P. J. Kenny, Martin Niland, and William Dickson as committee to draft a memorial. The following, submitted by the committee, was adopted unanimously: 

By the death of Capt. Robert Mills the sailing community and lake commerce generally has lost a steadfast and valuable friend. As master for many years he was true to the interests of all who served aboard ship. He always stood up for the rights of the common sailor, and by such his taking-off will be greatly deplored. 

In a practical way he assisted largely in building up the commerce of the great Jakes, and especially of Buffalo. As a ship builder his good work lives after him. He was one of the earliest to engage in the construction of vessels for what has now grown to be an immense traffic. 

Capt. Mills was a man of warm feelings and strong convictions. As husband, father, friend, he was kind, noble, generous. To his family his death has proved an irreparable loss, but they have the consolation afforded by the spotless reputation he has left behind him. 

Resolved, That this memorial be engrossed on the minutes of the Buffalo Excelsior Marine Benevolent Association, and that as a mark of our esteem, the members attend in a body the obsequies of our departed friend. 

The funeral of the late Captain Robert Mills took place this afternoon from the family residence 286 Prospect avenue. There was a large attendance of friends of the deceased. The bearers were Messrs. Hamilton Mills, M. C. Mills, John Rice, Albert Sikes, John Humble and Thomas Walsh.
