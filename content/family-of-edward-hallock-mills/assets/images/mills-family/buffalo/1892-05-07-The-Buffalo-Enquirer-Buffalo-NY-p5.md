Warren, and it is fitting that at its first meeting since this said occurrence some action be taken showing the profound grief which is felt by the citizens of this city, and the regard in which he was held by those who knew him when living. He was in the prime of life. He had taken an active part in all matters which pertained to the welfare and progress of the city of Buffalo. He was actively engaged in large business affairs. His conduct, whether in regard to private or public matters, was such as to win the esteem of those who came in contact with him and the praise of those who have seen the beneficent results of his work and example.

“We, the Common Council of the City of Buffalo, together with the citizens generally, mourn his death, and extend our sympathy to the bereaved members Of the family; therefore be it
