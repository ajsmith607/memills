IN MEMORIAM. 

Action of the Merchants’ Exchange on the Death of O. G. Warren. 

At 12 o’clock today a meeting was held at the Merchants’ Exchange rooms and resolutions adopted in regard to the late O. G. Warren, a member of the organization. A committee consisting of Messrs. Norman E. Mack, E H. Butler, George Bleistein and George E. Matthews had previously been appointed to draft the resolutions, which were as follows: 

MEMORIAL OF THE MERCHANTS’ EXCHANGE. In the death of Orsamus G. Warren the Merchants’ Exchange loses a member who was ever alert to the importance of organized effort and ever ready by word and deed to assist in everything tending to the upbuilding of our local institutions and the onward march of Buffalo as a great and growing commercial center. 

His death is a loss to the city at large because of his eminent respectability in public and private life; his high standing as the head of a newspaper whose Influence for good is known and respected in all sections of the State and country. 

To his family, relatives and associates in business we extend our deepest sympathies, assuring them that we share the sorrow and bear in part this burden of grief, a grief which is felt throughout the city and State. All who know him regret the sudden call and summons which removed him from the busy field of labor and honest endeavor to the reward he so justly earned and so faithfully strove for. 

Resolved. That this memorial minute be spread upon the minutes and a copy signed by the president, secretary and members of the committee be forwarded to the widow of our late beloved friend and associate. 

Among the prominent men who were present were John N. Scatcherd, George Sandrock, Daniel E. Newhall, William C. Newman, E. W. Eames, W. G. Heathfield, George Urban, W. C. Jacus, George H. Wolcott, N. C. Simons, F. J. Sawyer, Charles Sternberg, C. W. Ball, Frederick Truscott, Adam Homer, Miles Case, B. A. Rosseel, T. A. O'Brien, Mr. Carpenter and many others
