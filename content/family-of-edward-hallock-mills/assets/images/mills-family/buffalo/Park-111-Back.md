  - Charles D. Warren, James D. Warren's great-great grandson, via person correspondence 24 Oct 2022: "If the material at the Buffalo History Museum (and QPL) came from Louise Olmsted, that person may be Mary Louise Olmsted (1910-2008), the granddaughter of Orsamus George Warren (1846-1892). I know her younger sister, Elizabeth, had a keen interest in family history – she found and photographed the headstone of James D. Warren’s grandfather before it was vandalized. ... Also, the vandalized headstone of James Warren (James D. Warren’s grandfather) that I mentioned is located on Allegany Road as it passes through Darien (just a few miles south of Corfu)."

  - [Mary Louise Olmsted](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/119149503/mary-louise-olmsted) (27 May 1910 to 12 Jan 2008), granddaughter of Orsamus George Warren.
