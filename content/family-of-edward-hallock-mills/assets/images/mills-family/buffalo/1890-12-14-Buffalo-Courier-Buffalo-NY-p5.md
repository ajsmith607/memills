Many people wondered yesterday afternoon over a procession of about 50 fine-looking and well-dressed men, who, with a sad face and steady step, marched down Main and out Niagara Street. There was about them an air of quiet self-possession, and they impressed one with the idea that they were in the habit of doing well whatever they undertook, These men frequently have full charge of property worth from a hundred thousand to half a million dollars, under trying conditions, and they have the entire confidence of their superiors. They were members of the association of lake masters, and they were on the Way to pay a last tribute to the remains of Capt. Robert Mills, whom they all had learned to esteem for his many noble qualities and the helpful interest he had taken in lake commerce. Such a tribute means something.
