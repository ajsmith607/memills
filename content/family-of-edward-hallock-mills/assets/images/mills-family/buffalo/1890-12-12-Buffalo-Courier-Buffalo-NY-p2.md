OBITUARY.

Death of Robert Mills.

The grim reaper has been cutting a wide swath among Buffalo’s old and prominent residents. Added to the list of numerous well-known and valued citizens, who have recently closed long lives of usefulness which were closely identified with the prosperity and progress of the city, is Robert Mills, who died about 5:30 o'clock yesterday morning, at his home on Prospect Avenue. In his time he was an active business man and capable public official He was always a genial, companionable gentleman. For the last eight years he had been an invalid, the consequence of a paralytic attack. Last Monday evening he was smitten with: apoplexy, which destroyed consciousness, and he did not rally from the stroke.

Mr. Mills was born in Toronto on the 17th of November, 1824, being the son of Scotch parents who immigrated to Canada in the previous year. In that city his childhood was passed. When only 12 years old he came to Buffalo, and shipped as cabin-boy on the schooner John E. Hunt, which plied between this port and Chicago. From then until broken health compelled his retirement from all pursuits, be was associated with the interests of the great lakes, as sailor, master, vessel-owner, and ship-builder, At the early age of 21 he was captain of the brig Uncle Sam, and a little later he was master and became half owner of the brig Philadelphia. In turn thereafter he commanded the schooner George Davis, the brig Hampton, and the schooner Hope. He was owner of the latter craft, and also part owner of the schooner Kate L. Bruce, Then he built the fine schooner P. P. Pratt, which he sailed for six years, and until 1855, when he quit the sailor’s life and formed a partner ship with the late Patrick Walsh to carry on the business of ship-building. In 1866 they bought out the yard and drydock of F. N. Junes, on the south side of Buffalo River. The firm was then Mills & Co., comprising Mr. Mills, Mr. Walsh, and Capt. John Rice. After Mr. Walsh’s death in 1875, his interest in the business was retained by his heirs. Mr. Mills continued in active service until, as has been stated, he was eight years ago prostrated by paralysis. The firm was successful, and with a wide reputation for promptness and excellent work; many fine vessels were built at its yards. 

For a long time Mr. Mills was quite conspicuous in local polities, beginning his political career in 1859, when as a Republican he was elected Alderman for the almost invariably Democratic Eighth Ward. He was re-elected in 1861, but in 1863 was defeated, by only three votes. Appointed Inspector of Steam Vessels for this district by President Lincoln in 1861, he held that office for four years. From 1868 to 1874 he was chairman of the Republican County Committee. For 1871 and 1872 he was Canal Collector. Upon the reorganization of the Police Department in 1880, Mayor Alexander Brush appointed him Police Commissioner. He served in that capacity through Grover Cleveland's term as ‘Mayor, and until legislated out during Mr. Cleveland’s administration as Governor. That was his place in the public service, 

In 1845 Mr.  Mills was married to Margaret A. C. Cherry of Chautauqua County, who, with their three children, two sons and a daughter, survives him. He was a member of Hiram Lodge, F. and A. M., Buffalo Chapter, R. A. M., and Hugh de Payens Commandery of Knights Templar. Mr. Mills was firm in his convictions, rather blunt in his manner, but, as has been said, of kindly disposition, and he was respected for his intelligence as well as his integrity. His loss is a loss to the city.
