The Warren Funeral. 

Large Attendance of Distinguished Men in a Severe Snow Storm. 

The Body Placed in a Vault—The Burial Place Not Yet Settled. 

Letters of Condolence From Prominent Republicans and Editors Throughout the State. 

The severe snow storm that was blowing this afternoon did not prevent a very large attendance at the funeral of the late James D. Warren, proprietor of the Commercial Advertiser, which took place at the family residence on North street, at 2.30 o’clock this afternoon. Owing to the sad occasion only the first edition of the Commercial was issued and the establishment was closed for the remainder of the day. 

THE FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS. 

Rev. T. Ralston Smith, pastor of Westminster Presbyterian church, officiated at the obsequies. 

The remains rested in a solid cedar casket covered with fine black broadcloth, concave top and ornamented with a silk cord that extended around it, with tassels at each end. It was lined with pleated satin, richly trimmed and had oxydized silver extension bar and end handles. A solid silver plate bore the following inscription: 

JAMES D. WARREN, 

Born, JAN. 19, 1823. 

Died, Dec. 17, 1886. 

The casket was enclosed in a polished cedar box neatly trimmed with silver handles and bearing a copper plate with inscription. 

The gentlemen who acted as honorary bearers were: Hon. Charles Daniels. Gen. R. L. Howard, Hon. Nelson K. Hopkins, Hon. James M. Humphrey, John L. Williams, Henry W. Box, A. P. Wright, Robert Keating. 

The bearers were: James A. Roberts, George Urban Jr., Col. John Byrne, Judge George A. Lewis, Hon. Jacob Stern, Henry C. French, William E. Clark and William B. Sinett. 

After the services at the house were completed the remains were taken to Forest Lawn and placed in the vault. Here they will remain temporarily. The family has not yet determined definitely upon the place of burial and it may be that the remains will be placed at rest at the side of those of Mr. Warren’s lamented father at. Clarence.
