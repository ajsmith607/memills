O. G. WARREN DEAD 

The Republican Leader Passed Away at 9:20 O’Clock This Morning. 

HISTORY OF HIS CAREER. 

He Made a Brave But Unsuccessful Fight Against Dread Pneumonia. 

HIS PLACE IN POLITICS. 

After an illness of only one week Orsamus George Warren died this morning at 9:20 o’clock at his residence, No. 222 West North Street. The direct cause of death was pneumonia, accompanied by congestion. 

Orsamus George Warren was born in Clarence, Erie County, N. Y., on July 21, 1846. His father was the late James D. Warren, and his mother Laura Love. Passing his childhood days at Clarence, Orsamus’ father did not move into Buffalo to reside until 1854. At that time James D. Warren had just received the office of County Treasurer, which for two terms he held, and in order to facilitate matters he moved into Buffalo, where he and his family made their permanent residence. Little Orsamus was sent to Buffalo Public School No. 14 for three years, and then was placed under tuition at Clarence, where he studied primary classics, and was coached for matriculation at college. He then attended the college at Canandaigua, but his health failing he was sent abroad in the summer of his 17th year. He remained on the continent for 18 months, and studied French classics for six months at the University of Paris, where he creditably acquitted himself. He was nearly 20 years old when, returning to America he entered his father’s office, the *Commercial*, taking a position in the counting room as a clerk. Here he worked for some time, and after several years of service in this manner, his father rewarded him by a gift of a quarter interest in newspaper. 

The next event of his life was his marriage in 1875 with Miss Elizabeth B. Griffin, daughter of the late John B. Griffin. 

By this marriage they have four children all of whom with the mother survive. They are Gertrude aged 15, James D. aged 14, Helen aged 8, and Elizabeth aged 7. Since his marriage he devoted all his business hours to the Commercial and Republican polities, and at the time of his father’s death succeeded his sire, in partnership with his brother, in the proprietorship of the paper. He was the recognized leader of the Republican party in Erie County and Western New York at one time having been a State Committeeman, and at the recent Republican Convention he was elected as delegate to the Minneapolis Convention. His alternate for this latter honor is Mr. Daniel J. Kenetick. 

HIS LAST ILLNESS, 

Last Thursday evening, a week ago last night, he returned to Buffalo from the Republican Convention at Albany, whither he went from New York city. Friday morning he complained that he had taken a bad chill the day before and was not feeling very well. He went to business, however, but returned before his usual hour in the afternoon and said to his family that he was feeling real miserable. He retired and Dr. Stockton was called. He diagnosed a severe cold and thought that it was nothing dangerous. Saturday found no improvement in the patient and it was given out by his medical adviser that the illness might develop typhoid fever or pneumonia. Still all hoped for the best, and his condition did not grow worse until Wednesday when the dangerous and unmistakable symptoms of pneumonia appeared. Drs. Cary and Rochester were called into consultation by Dr, Stockton. The patient appeared to improve under a slight change of treatment. At 10 o’clock last night the doctors were real hopeful and the patient cheerful. His condition showed a marked change for the better, and there were better grounds for hoping to save him. At midnight the doctors were quite encouraged, and Mr. Warren made a determined struggle. 

“We are bound to make you well,” said Dr, Stockton. 

“And I am bound to get well,” said the patient bravely. He continued to improve until morning approached. At 3 o'clock a great change for the worse set in and he began sinking rapidly. Nothing would aid him, and he continued to decline. At 6 o’clock delerium set in, This was the last fatal symptom. The delerium continued at intervals, and at 9:20 he died. 

THE FUNERAL. 

The funeral will take place from his house, of which announcements will be made later. He was in life a staunch member of the First Presbyterian Church, and it is to that religious body that the ceremonies will be entrusted. 

MEETING OF NEWSPAPER MEN. 

President Kingsley of the Buffalo Press Club, of which organization Mr. Warren was au honorary member, has called a special meeting of the club to be held at 4 P. M. tomorrow (Saturday). All newspaper writers are invited lo attend.
