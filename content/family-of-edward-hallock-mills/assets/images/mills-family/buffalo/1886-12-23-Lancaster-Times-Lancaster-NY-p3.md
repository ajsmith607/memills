Death of James D. Warren. 

The death of James. D. Warren, proprietor of the Buffalo Commercial, occurred at his residence on North Street, Buffalo, at 8:30 o'clock, on Friday evening last. 

Mr. Warren was born on a farm in the town of Bennington, Wyoming county, N. Y., January 19, 1823. His father, the late Orsamus Warren, was one of the pioneers of Western New York. After a brief residence in Bennington, the elder Warren removed with his family to the town of Wales, Erie county, and again to Clarence, where he settled upon a farm located about a mile from the village. James D. was two years old when this settlement was made. He worked upon the farm as be grew to youth and manhood, assisted also in the management of the village store which his father owned. Here, in the midst of an endless variety of merchandise, with supplies to be bought and sold, accounts to be kept, he acquired a business training and a better knowledge of the world than the drudgery of farm life afforded. His neighbors began to see in him a keen, enterprising man, one who has a good future before him and one in whose hands their own interests could be safely trusted. So they elected him Supervisor several times in succession, as against older and more experienced men. His record in the Board of Supervisors made him the Republican candidate for treasurer of Erie County in 1854, when he was only 3l years of age. He was elected. After serving a term of three years he retired, but was soon chosen to the position of clerk of the Board of Supervisors. He was twice re-elected to this position. In April, 1861, in connection with Joseph Wheeler and Joseph Candee, he purchased the Commercial Advertiser and entered upon the active life of a publisher. In 1862 Messrs. Wheeler and Warren purchased Mr. Candee’s interest and then admitted James N. Matthews into the firm. Mr. Wheeler retired from the concern in 1864 and the firm then became Mathews & Warren. The partnership continued for 13 years. In 1877 the disagreement of the partners resulted in the purchase by Mr. Warren of Mr. Matthews’ interest. Since that time the former has been the sole proprietor of the paper. While holding no other offices than those already mentioned, Mr. Warren has never ceased to be an active and influential Republican. Mr. Warren was twice married, his first wife having been Miss Laura Love, daughter of the late George Love, by whom he had one son. After her death he married Miss Mary Mills, daughter of the late Judge Mills, by whom he had one son and two daughters. Mr. Warren was for a number of years prior to his death president of White's Bank of Buffalo. 

The funeral took place Monday afternoon from his late residence.
