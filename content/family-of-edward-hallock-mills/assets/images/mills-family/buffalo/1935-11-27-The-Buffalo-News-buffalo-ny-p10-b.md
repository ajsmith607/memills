**W. C. WARREN DIES IN HOME** 

**Ex-Buffalo Publisher Was Leader in G.O.P. Affairs.** 

William C. Warren, 76, former Buffalo newspaper publisher and prominent figure in political affairs for many years, died at 4 o'clock this morning in his residence, 173 North street. 

Of sturdy physique, Mr. Warren had been in excellent health until three days ago. Saturday, in fact, he had walked downtown. Sunday he contracted a cold, old age complications set in, then death followed. 

The funeral will be held Saturday afternoon at 2:30 o'clock in the home, Burial will be in Forest Lawn cemetery. Dr, Ralph B. Hindman, pastor of First Presbyterian church, will officiate. 

Mr. Warren, on graduation from college in 1880, started his newspaper career on the Buffalo Commercial, which his father owned. In 1894 he became its publisher and continued until 1918, when he
retired. The Commercial has since gone out of existence. 

**Held Three Posts.** 

An outstanding Republican, Mr. Warren reached the zenith of his political life around the turn of the century, He served as state committeeman, as county chairman, and as delegate to the national conventions in 1900 and 1904. 

Back in the days when Benjamin B. Odell was running New York state in his capacity as governor, and also running the Republican portion thereof as chairman of the party's state committee, Mr. Warren loomed large on the political horizon, not only in Buffalo, but throughout the state. 

Clark H. Timmerman was chairman of the Erie county Republican committee and Henry Seilheimer was secretary, having just been made son on the advancement of the late George D. Emerson, long-time secretary, to the newly created position of commissioner of elections, but Mr. Warren was leader and recognized as such at home and abroad. 

**Post Was Important.**

The only political post he held was state committeeman, this being for the old West side Congressional district so long represented by the late Col. D. S. Alexander, but in those days a state committeeman, representing as he did a Congressional district instead of half an Assembly district, as is the case under the present law, was of distinct size in his community and outside of it.

Others on the state committee at that time were such political giants of their day as the late William Barnes Jr. of Albany, the late George W. Aldridge of Rochester, the late Francis Hendricks of Syracuse, the late J. Sloat Fassett of Elmira, the late George W. Dunn of Binghamton and last of the Old Guard to go, the late William L. Ward who dominated Westchester county for well over a quarter of a century.

**Son of G. O. P. Leader.**

Towering over all of them, however, stood Gov. Odell, who had recently unhorsed the venerable Thomas C. Platt as state leader and was functioning as such in the dual role of governor-chairman, a role which drew some criticism, of course, but not sufficient in volume to seriously ruffle that militant partisan.

Mr. Warren came rather naturally into his leadership. He was the son of James D. Warren, in his day one of the leaders in the Republican party in New York state, pal of Platt's, one-time chairman of the state committee and a delegate to one or two national conventions, besides bossing the party locally in the days when Grover Cleveland and his political intimates were giving the Republicans some worthwhile opposition.

James D. Warren passed on and his mantle fell on the shoulders of his son, the late Orsamus G. Warren, elder brother of William C. Warren.

**Hazel Takes Reins.**

On the death of "O. G.," as he was known, John R. Hazel took over the Republican machine and ran it most efficiently until made a federal judge by President McKinley.

When he ascended the bench for the Wester district of New York, from which he only recently stepped down on attaining the age limit, he turned the Republican machine over to William C. Warren, who entered upon a leadership in which he held sway in spite of opposition both within and without the party until he, like Gov. Odell, his chief, was eventually toppled from power.

In those days Mr. Warren was the directing force on the old Buffalo Commercial, started by his father with his nephew, the present James D. Warren and other aides, including William C. Foster, managing editor; Frank M. Hollister and Arthur Austin, associate editors; A. E. Richmond, city editor, all since passed on.

**Faced Much Strife.**

From a little back office on the first floor of the Commercial building Mr. Warren was wont to issue orders which were obeyed in the matter of county and municipal nominations.

Working with him as state committeeman for the old East side Congressional district, represented at Washington by William H. Ryan, was John Grimm, aided by the late Simon Seibert and sundry other lieutenants, most of them now deceased.

Not that Mr. Warren, even at the height of his power, held unquestioned sway over his political domain. Few leaders do. Mr. Warren faced strife aplenty within the Republican ranks. The late Fred Greiner, then postmaster, was restive under his rule. The late Edward H. Butler generally found himself out of step and so did the late George E. Mathews, aligning the Evening News and the Express together against the Commercial on more than one battlefront.

**Machine Beaten.**

Finally, in the Summer of 1905, the long anticipated break came in the open. A combination of state chieftains lined up behind Gov. Frank W. Higgins, with former Gov. Odell as their objective. Odell leaders faced a fight for control throughout the state. Here in Erie county Mr. Greiner stepped out in front with the late John G. Wickser as his candidate for state committeeman. 

In the alignment that marked that memorable battle County Chairman Timmerman threw in his political fortunes with Mr. Greiner. So did John Grimm. So did Simon Seibert. The Evening News was hurled into the center of the fray by Mr. Butler. Under the weight of this onslaught the Warren machine went down to defeat.

**Odell Man Loses.**

So, on the larger state stage, did the Odell machine, At the opening of the next session of the Legislature in 1906, the Odell candidate for speaker of the Assembly, the late Edwin A. Merritt of St. Lawrence county, was beaten by a young, second-year member from Livingston county, James W. Wadsworth by name, whom Gov. Higgins and the newly-enthroned state leaders had picked as their candidate. Oddly enough, except that nothing is so very odd in politics they had the support of President Theodore Roosevelt, despite the fact that the strenuous "T. R." had only recently incited rebellion in the Livingston - Niagara - Orleans - Genesee - Wyoming Congressional district against the elder Wadsworth and driven him from Congress after many years of distinguished service.

**Drops Active Politics.**

Following his defeat, Mr. Warren dropped out of active politics. It wasn't so many years afterward that he sold the Commercial, which a brace of new owners wrecked in short order. Thereafter he devoted himself to looking after his property which a shrewd eye for business had amassed during his busy career. So completely did he withdraw from the political game that when, two years ago, he appeared at Elmwood Music hall to hear Representative Wadsworth on the occasion his speech there, veterans present had to rub their eyes and take a second look.

Mr. Warren was a high type of political boss who played the game according to the rules which governed it in his day, rules which included no direct primaries and no women's suffrage, both presenting perplexing complications to his successors. He had devoted followers and, like all political leaders, he faced and battled with bitter enemies. In the midst of the hottest political battle he ever remained the gentleman. And his word, once passed, was not to be questioned or doubted. 

**Was Buffalo Native.**

Born in this city Aug. 4, 1859, Mr. Warren came of old Buffalo stock. His grandparents, Orsamus and Nancy Joslyn Warren, were Buffalonians. His father, James D. Warren, operated the old Buffalo Commercial Advertiser and founded the Commercial. His mother was Mary Mills Warren.

William C. Warren received his education in the public schools, Briggs Classical school and Yale college. He was graduated from Yale with the degree of bachelor of philosophy.

After he retired from the Commercial, Mr. Warren had no specific business connections except a directorship of the Buffalo, Niagara & Eastern Power company.

Surviving are his wife, Mrs. Clara S. Wright Warren; two sons, William C. Warren Jr., Buffalo, and John D. Warren, New York; and a daughter, Mrs. Edward Streeter, New York.

Mr. Warren was a member of the First Presbyterian church. He belonged also to the Buffalo Country club, University and Yale clubs of New York, and Graduate club of New Haven.
