Buffalo Man Found Dead Near Springville. 

Springvilie, June 18.â€“Thomas H. Mills of Bryant Street, Buffalo, was found dead near this village last night. Mr. Mills had been in the habit of spending his summers in this place and, coming as usual this year, made his home with Dr. Bates, a short distance north of the village. He was devoted to outdoor life and for the past few days had been at work in a grove in the rear of the Bates residence in making a croquet ground. Yesterday afternoon he took his horse and, apparently good health, as usual, went back to the unfinished work. No one paid any attention to him, until about 6 o'clock some one passing through the grove noticed him lying on the ground, dead. Help was obtained and the body carried to the house and Dr. Brooks of this place summoned, who declared that he had been dead for some time, probably due to heart disease. The coroner for the South Towns was notified. Mr. Mills was a man of considerable age and not of strong constitution, having been a victim in the past to a severe sunstroke. The deceased leaves a brother and sister, both of whom reside on Bryant Street, Buffalo.
