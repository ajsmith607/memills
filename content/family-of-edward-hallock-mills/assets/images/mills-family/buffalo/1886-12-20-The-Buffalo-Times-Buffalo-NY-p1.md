In opening the meeting the mayor paid a glowing tribute to the memory of the deceased gentleman, of whom he said had been a personal friend for forty years. The city had lost one of its most worthy citizens in the death of Mr. Warren. 

On motion of Mr. I. O. Crissy the mayor was elected chairman of the meeting and Surrogate Stern was appointed secretary. The following gentlemen were present, Messrs, Murphy, Martin, Smith, Knapp, Albro, Briger, Moest, White, McMaster, Cutting, Gilbert, Kenney, Durney, Rogers, Orr, Ryan, Reichert, Delaney, Crissy, Newell, Smith, Worthington, Carmichael, Baker, Crowder, Barnard, Cloak, Esser, Titus, Lewis, Crooker, Laughlin, Ald. Kennedy, Mock and E. W. Hatch. 

Mr. Laughlin moved that the chair appoint a committee of five to draft suitable resolutions, and the following gentlemen were named as such committee by his honor: Messrs. Laughlin, Esser, Crooker and Judges Lewis and Titus. The committee reported the following memorial and resolution, which were unanimously adopted:  

THE MEMORIAL. 

We the officials and others employed at the city and county hall were extremely grieved on learning of the death of our esteemed fellow citizen, James D. Warren, and moved by a common impulse and appreciation of the great loss thus sustained have come together to express our sorrow and pay our humble tribute of respect to the distinguished dead.

By his breadth of intellect, his liberal views, his indefatigable enterprise and his untiring devotion to the welfare of our city for upwards of thirty years he contributed largely to its growth and prosperity. By his truthfulness, honest, integrity and superior business ability and tact he was remarkably successful, winning the confidence and full esteem of all, and was justly regarded as the soul of commercial honor.

By his high moral standard combined with rare talent he did inestimable good in elevating the character and tone of the press and by furnishing our people with a pure and able journal. Endowed with an affable manner, a generous heart and an affection for his friends, by the aid of his almost perfect knowledge of human nature coupled with a superior judgement and strong political conviction he early became a leader in his party and was long prominent in its councils throughout the state and the nation.

His noble character and upright life, which were crowned with deserved success, have me the approval of a multitude of his bereaved fellow-countrymen and are worthy the emulation of all.

Resolved, That this testimonial be furnished the press and an engrossed copy be transmitted to the grief stricken family and that we attend the funeral" Judge Lewis spoke briefly on the deceased gentleman bearing testimony to his many virtues and integrity.

Superior Court Judge-elect Hatch, Judge Titus and Issac O. Crissy followed in the same strain after which the meeting adjourned.

The Warren Funeral.

Large Attendance of Distinguished Men in a Severe Snow Storm.

The Body Placed in a Vault—The Burial Place Not Yet Settled.

Letters of Condolence From Prominent Republicans and Editors Throughout the State. 

The severe snow storm that was blowing this afternoon did not prevent a very large attendance at the funeral of the late James D. Warren, proprietor of the *Commercial Advertiser*, which took place at the family residence on North street, at 2.30 o'clock this afternoon. Owing to the sad occasion only the first edition of the *Commercial* was issued and the establishment was closed for the remainder of the day. 

THE FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS. 

Rev. T. Ralston Smith, pastor of Westminster Presbyterian church, officiated at the obsequies.  

The remains rested in a solid cedar casket covered with fine black broadcloth, concave top and ornamented with a silk cord that extended around it, with tassels at end. It was lined with plated satin, richly trimmed and had oxydized silver extension bar and end handles. A solid silver plate  bore the following inscription:

JAMES D. WARREN,

BORN, Jan. 19, 1823. 

DIED, Dec. 17, 1886. 

The casket was enclosed in a polished cedar box neatly trimmed with silver handles and bearing a copper plate with inscription.
