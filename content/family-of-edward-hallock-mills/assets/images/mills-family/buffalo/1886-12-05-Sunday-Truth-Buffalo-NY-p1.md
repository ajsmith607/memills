Mr. Warren's Condition.

The following appeared in the last edition of the *Commercial* of yesterday: "During the week now closing there has not been any very marked change in the condition of Mr. James D. Warren. He has not lost any ground, however, and there was a slight improvement upon his condition on Wednesday last. What change there has been, slight as it may be, is in the direction of improvement. His physicians to-day report, after consultation at noon, that while their patient's condition does not materially abate their great anxiety, it does justify strong hope, especially in consideration of Mr. Warren's vigorous constitution that may enable him to 'pull through.'"
