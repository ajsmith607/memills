The chair stated that it was his melancholy duty to formally announce the death of a former member of the Board—James -D. Warren, who represented the town of Clarence in the years 1852-54, and who served subsequently as Clerk of the Board of Supervisors and County Treasurer. It was unnecessary, he said, to supplement the many eloquent tributes that had been deservingly paid our deceased and respected fellow-citizen, of whom it was not too much to say that as a political organizer he ranked with the foremost in the State or country. It was eminently proper that a memorial to the deceased should be spread on the minutes of the Board, and in doing this the chair had no doubt those of opposite political convictions would join as heartily as those who were his partisans, for though he was cordial and true to is friends he was ever fair and generous to his political opponents. 

On motion of Mr. Beard the chair appointed a committee of five—Messrs. Smither, Beard, Humbert, Willis, and Staffin—to draft suitable resolutions on the death of Mr. Warren and a memorial page for that purpose was set apart in the published proceedings of the board.
