â€”James D, Warren, proprietor of the Buffalo *Commercial*, died in that city on Friday last, aged 63 years. The deceased had been ill since October last, although until a few hours before his death hope was entertained for his recovery. Mr. Warren was a prominent leader of the Republican party and his death is a great loss.
