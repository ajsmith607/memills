TO MR. WARREN'S FRIENDS.

The publication of the COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER will not be suspended today–the day fixed for the funeral of JAMES D. WARREN–but only one edition will be issued. The twelve o’clock edition will be served to all subscribers alike. This arrangement will enable all persons connected with the establishment to testify, in some small degree to the affectionate esteem in which they held their late employer by attending the funeral this afternoon.

Hoping and believing that all readers of the COMMERCIAL are friends of our dead chief we need not ask their kind indulgence at this hour. We give up today’s paper largely to expression of public and private grief elicited by Mr. WARREN’S untimely death. On this page are reproduced the local tributes; on the fourth page, those from abroad. During the past forty-eight hours a great number of telegrams and letters of condolence and sympathy have been received by Mr. WARREN’S family, from all parts of the state and from Washington. These messages are from warm personal friends and former political comrades. They all testify to the honor in which they held Mr. WARREN and their sense of the loss suffered by themselves by the party and by the state, in his death. These message are prized extremely by Mr. WARREN’S family: but, for the present at least, will not be made public. 

To its exchanges throughout the state, the COMMERCIAL begs leave to say that their comments on Mr. WARREN’S taking-off are gratefully appreciated, and that if any are omitted in our extracts the fact is owing to irregularity in the mails or to accident.

Buffalo Sunday News.

The *Sunday News* can but add it mite to the testimony of hundreds of friends—private, business and political to the many admirable traits of the late JAMES D. WARREN. Unobtrusive in his private life, winning his friendships through the qualities of his nature, and not through seeking or advances, he manifest the same disposition in politics. He was recognized as a great power in local, state and national politics, but he showed no desire to thrust himself forward. Had he been spared to occupy a seat in the United States senate, where many desired to see him, his sterling honesty, strong common sense and financial ability would have been of great benefit to this country. But neither that nor any other public honor would have come to him at his own solicitation. The republican party in this section has lost its ablest and greatest leader, and one whom the lieutenants followed with more enthusiasm than is likely to be raised for any possible successor.
 
Buffalo Sunday Truth.

By this demise this community sustains a great loss, not only on account of the position he occupied and the influences he exercised, but also because of the example he set in his daily life of love and fidelity to his family, geniality to those associated with him in business and rugged honesty in all his public affairs. The high position he attained in the republican politics of the state was not due to personal ambition any more than the success of his newspaper, the COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER, and its accompanying printing establishment was the result of any positive genius or special training. From working on his father’s farm and trading in a country store he developed into a careful, judicious, reliable business man. He was unswervingly faithful to his friends, and the fact that changes on the staff of his newspaper were very few and far between testifies alike to their zeal and ability and his just appreciation thereof.

We most earnestly extend our sympathy to the family, and to all who very immediately feel the weight of this great bereavement.

Buffalo Times.

MR. WARREN was marked our for a leader of men; strong, self-reliant, generous even to his adversaries, just ever to his friends, he was one who invariably commanded the respect of others. He was three times supervisor and long a member of the republican state committee and a leader in the councils of his party.

In private life Mr. WARREN was a man of genial, pleasant manners and a general favorite. He was, in fine, a gentleman and one who held courageously and sternly to his own opinions. 

The *Times* reiterates that the city and state have lost in Mr. WARREN an exponent of true and noble manhood, the republican party a leader, his employes a friend and his family a father. The sympathy of the community is with the stricken family.

From the Buffalo Free Press of the 18th.

The publisher of the COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER, JAMES D. WARREN, died yesterday in his 64th year, after a sickness of a few weeks’ duration from a hereditary affliction. The mourning over his death, which came rather unexpected, as his physicians had only lately given hopes for his recover, is in this city a universal one, and will also be felt in the larger circles, there the deceased, on account of his many excellent qualities, was held in the highest esteem. Here everybody knew him as a citizen of sterling worth, as an able and reliable business man, as a politician in the best sense of the word. In this, his latter capacity, he had the confidence of his party associates, the republicans, far over the limits of this state and could be proud of the friendship of the most eminent men in the country. The late ex-President Arthur, whom death took away a few weeks ago, being an intimate friend of his. Nobody did dare to dispute his party leadership in the city and country, whilst he was among us yet; for years he was the managing spirit of it and saw to its interests in the executive committee of the state and at the national conventions. Gifted with a rare talent of organization, he hardly ever made a mistake in selecting his political co-workers. To his friends he remained always true, upon his word everybody could rely–this explains his universal popularity. In the late years his name was often mentioned in connection with high offices, but it seemed as if he was unwilling to leave the sphere of activity so dear to him, for the COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER, a paper that in it present equipment has shown itself as a surpassing success, may as such be called a creation of his own.

The *Freie Prssse*, and with it the German republicans of the city and county, whilst deploring deeply the loss, which this community and the party endures through this death, shall forever honor the memory of him who has gone from us.

Translated from the Demokrat, December 18th.

By the death of Mr. JAMES D. WARREN, which occurred last evening, Buffalo has lost one of her most prominent citizens. The grave disease from which he suffered for a long time, from the outset, left little room for the hope of an eventual recovery; yet the favorable accounts recently received regarding his condition had the effect that the announcement of his death was a sudden and severe blow to his numerous friends.

For many years, MR. WARREN occupied one of the most conspicuous positions among the business men of our city, part owner and finally sole proprietor of the COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER. That paper for its growth and present prominent and influential place among the newspapers of the state is greatly indebted to MR. WARREN’S business sagacity and tact. The republican party of our state has lost in him one of its most distinguished leaders. The success which that party in recent years achieved in this section of the state, was largely due to the loyalty, zeal and skillful management of the deceased. A strict party ma, he was highly esteemed by his political opponents. In his business relations he distinguished himself by strict integrity and honorable dealing. He had few enemies and many friends and his memory will always be honored by those who knew him. To his afflicted family and co-workers in the large establishment of which he was the head, we express our heartfelt sympathy.
