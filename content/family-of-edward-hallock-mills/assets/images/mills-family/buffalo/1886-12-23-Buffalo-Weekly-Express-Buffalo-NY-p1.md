*Wednesday's Proceedings.*

The Board of Supervisors at its meeting yesterday morning received and adopted the following memorial in honor of the late James D. Warren:

IN MEMORIAM,

James D. Warren,

Died December 17, 1886.

James D. Warren was born in the year 1823 in the town of Bennington, Wyoming County. His early life was spent in the town of Clarence, Erie County, which town he able represented in the Board of Supervisors for years 1852-4, when he was elected to the responsible position of County Treasurer. For more than a quarter of a century Mr. Warren has been one of the most prominent figures in the politics of our country, and although rarely seeking office himself he has, more than any other man, moulded the political destinies of his city and county.

Whatever person ambitions Mr. Warren may have had they seem to have been generously deferred that he might the more effectually advance the interests of his friends. Yet in his ripe years his [] loyalty to his party and friends, his excellent judgement and sound practical views of men and measures, have in spite of his unostentatious manner, caused him to be justly recognized as one of the greatest political organizers in the State. In more than one sense Mr. Warren was a stalwart of the stalwarts; he was stalwart, true, and steadfast in his support of his friends, stalwart, frank, and generous in his opposition to his adversaries; his friends learned to love, his adversaries to respect him.

Prominently identified with the commercial interests of our city for many years, his material success eloquently attest his business ability and integrity, while his generous and hearty support has never been wanting in any public enterprise.

Amid expressions of eloquent sorrow on every hand, Erie County assigns to James D. Warren an honored place with her illustrious dead.
