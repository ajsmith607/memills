THE LATE MR. WARREN. 

ACTION OF VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS. 


Tributes of Affection and Respect.—A Medical History of the Case.—The Funeral this Afternoon. 

The obsequies of the late JAMES D. WARREN, proprietor of the COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER, will be held at 2.30 o'clock this afternoon at the family residence on North street. Owing to the sad occasion, only the first (noon) edition of the COMMERCIAL will be issued today, and the establishment will be closed this afternoon. 

In view of the interest that has attached to the case of MR. WARREN, and to correct any misapprehensions that may exist, the COMMERCIAL publishes the following history of the case as dictated by Dr. John D. Hill, his attending physician: 

THE HISTORY OF THE CASE. 

MR. JAMES D. WARREN first consulted me on the 18th day of September, 1886, with such symptoms as he. MR. WARREN, generally called "bilious,” and he asked that I should give him "some medicine,” and 1 prescribed such medicine as I was in the habit of prescribing for him under like circumstances, and with such symptoms as he had frequently complained of: but without the usual beneficial result. Three or four days after, the same remedies were repeated and followed, in connection with doses of quinine, three times a day. In the meantime MR. WARREN in his own view and that of his physician, showed symptoms of gradual improvement. He was desirous to visit New York: he thought the visit would do him good; he had not been there since his management of the Blaine campaign; he was receiving letters from old political friends urging him to be in New York at the meeting of the state committee, and he went with my approval. He was there four or five days, but did not see me until a week had elapsed since my last interview with him. On his return he said he thought his trip had done him good: that he was feeling better than he was when he left Buffalo. Within a few days after his return, i.e. the 18th of October, he consulted me for several days in succession with symptoms of mild cystitis. These became daily more aggravated, though not enough so to interfere with his going to the office and the bank. On the 28th of October at my request he submitted to physical examination of the bladder and the prostate gland. This examination revealed acute inflammation of the prostate gland and neck of the bladder, which was accompanied from that time with acute physical suffering. At this period MR. WARREN gave up all attention to business; remained at home; did not take to his bed, but determined to devote himself to getting well. The usual vigorous treatment for relief of inflammation of this character was resorted to, and resulted in great relief to the patient and with apparent control of the disease; so much so that on the 2d of November he went to the polls and voted; it proved to be the last time of his leaving the house. At this time the patient evinced symptoms of what is generally called "nervous prostration,"— the symptoms of return to usual health did not appear; on the contrary, extreme lassitude and manifest indifference to outside objects, lack of interest in what was going on about him; while there was great relief of painful symptoms, the symptoms of actual recovery did not exhibit themselves, as was reasonable to anticipate. There was an aggravation of these depressing mental and nervous symptoms up to the 25th of November, culminating in his first and the only chill that he had had up to that time—and prior to the day of his death. From the 25th and onward his symptoms grew more and more grave with occasional periods of slight amelioration. From this date he voided pus with the urine, with the exception of about two or three days. On the 7th or 8th of December a slight puffing in the femoral region was discovered, and was slightly tender to the touch. All this time, owing to the persistency of the depressing nervous symptoms referred to above, MR. WARREN was kept under the influence of antiseptic remedies, from the cessation of the acute inflammation of the prostate gland up to within a short time prior to decease. Up to within a period of twelve days prior to his death, MR. WARREN lost very little flesh, lost little of his rotundity, or his appearance of ruddy health and vigorous nutrition, and exhibited little or no loss of muscular force. It is the opinion of Dr. Hill, with full knowledge of the history of MR. WARREN’S case and from the developments in the autopsy, that MR. WARREN had not been in good general health for some time; that he was in a condition predisposed to acute inflammatory attacks, and without his usual power of recuperation; that the acute inflammation developed in the prostate gland resulted in the formation of pus, instead of resolution as was hoped and expected at the time. The pus there formed was taken up by absorbents and deposited in the supra-renal capsule of the left kidney, and there a pyogenic pocket formed and developed into a large abscess: and from this abscess arose those symptoms of nervous depression attributable, in the revelation of the autopsy, to a septic influence that was gradually poisoning MR. WARREN'S entire system—this septic poison from this abscess, baffling the detection of his physicians, gradually sapped the foundations of MR. WARREN'S vigorous constitution and eventually caused his death. MR. WARREN from the first feared that he was afflicted with inflammation of the bladder from which his father died. As the physician in both cases, and with the developments of an autopsy in each case, Dr. Hill finds that heredity was not a potent factor in JAMES D. WARREN’S case. In the father’s case was hypertrophy of the prostate gland with chronic inflammation of the bladder. In the case of the son was acute inflammation of the prostate gland, with formation of pus and septic intoxication. Mr. JAMES D. WARREN'S fear that he would die as his father died, while not justified by the course of his own disease, was most unfortunate, and led from the first to great depression on his part. 

The autopsy revealed that with the exception of such modifications as are above noted, all of MR. WARREN’S internal organs that wore examined were in a condition of such health as to warrant a belief that he should have been good for twenty years more except for the action of the septic poison already mentioned. 

Concerning the report and opinion that have prevailed that Mr. WARREN died of hereditary disease, in the form of inflammation of the bladder, Dr. Burwell authorized the statement that "in relation to the degree of inflammation of the bladder, from the autopsy of MR. WARREN it was found to be limited to the bas-fond of the bladder, and consisted of a circular spot of about an inch in diameter in which the mucus membrane was partially injected and partially ecchymosed— in and of itself not at all beyond the probability of complete recovery.”  

ACTION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEAGUE. 

A special meeting of the Buffalo Republican League was held on Saturday evening to take action on the death of Mr. WARREN. There was a large attendance. 

President Ogden P. Letchworth, in stating the sad duty for which the League had met, fittingly referred to the great loss which city and state have suffered. He called upon, as better qualified to speak of the work and worth of MR. WARREN, Mr. S. C. Adams, an honorary member of the organization, and for many years a bosom friend of MR. WARREN. Mr. Adams was visibly affected, and as he spoke was so deeply moved that his voice was controlled with difficulty. His acquaintance with Mr. WARREN dated from 1852, when the latter represented Clarence in the board of supervisors, and he himself represented Collins. He had learned to love him as a brother. 

Messrs. Seward A. Simons, Emory P. Close and William L. Marcy were appointed a committee to draft a suitable memorial, which was read by Mr. Simons as follows:  

The Republican League has learned with deep sorrow of the death of JAMES D. WARREN, and unites in the genuine sentiment of public bereavement which is universal in this community. 

MR. WARREN drew to himself with rare attractiveness a host of loyal friends, because he himself never betrayed one whose friendship he enjoyed. His name was a synonym of financial integrity, business worth, and untiring energy. His political life was one of conscientious fidelity and consistent devotion to a great party in whose principles he believed, the confidence of whose honored leaders he merited and received. His unswerving loyalty was marked by no personal ambition, his service was freely bestowed with no thought of recompense in position or power. His integrity of purpose never recognized a selfish end, he was a worthy leader, a trusted friend, a broad and liberal man, and a pure-minded citizen. 

As a mark of respect to his memory, it is appropriate that the rooms of the League be draped in mourning for 50 days. 

Mr. Simons moved the adoption of the resolution. Mr. Close, in seconding the motion, said: 

In the funereal hush and shadow of, MR. WARREN’S death it is difficult to fitly speak. We are met here to pay honor and homage to the memory of a pure man, a distinguished citizen, and a brave leader. To me the announcement comes with the - oppressive weight of a deep personal loss. It was my privilege to know MR. WARREN intimately. During the presidential campaign of 1884, when MR. WARREN was chairman of the state committee, at his request I accompanied him to New York, and remained during the last two months of that active campaign, and had many opportunities of appreciating his administrative skill, his able leadership and unfaltering zeal. Strength, candor and loyalty were the leading characteristics of his nature. His strength was show in a firmness of purpose and conviction which could brook no opposition; in an energy and enterprise which commanded and achieved success. His candor was exhibited by his open and ingenuous utterances. His friends could always rely upon the assurances of his aid; his foes were promptly advised of an opposition which gave and asked no quarter. With him, the promise to the ear was never broken to the hope; his speech was ever the transparent vesture of his thought. His loyalty was demonstrated by an adherence to principle and to friend which never wavered, never doubted, never failed.

Mr. WARREN was the truly valiant man, who dared nothing but what he should; who feared nothing but what he ought. Noble in life, he is splendid in ashes, and will be eminent in the grave. He has gone from us forever. Nothing remains for us but indulge ourselves in that sweet anxiety which arises from the memory of a great affliction. He at last has joined the everlasting majority. He leaves behind him the recollections of

Only those actions of the just

Which smell sweet and blossom in the dust.

Mr. N. S Rosenau, in briefly paying his tribute of respect to MR. WARREN'S memory, dwelt especially upon the great modesty of the man, who, while a leader, was contented and glad to remain in the ranks. He had made it his ambition to make famous the names and careers of other men. It was but fitting that the League should endeavor to keep green the memory of him who sought no honor for himself.

REMARKS OF MR. LAUGHLIN.

Mr. Chairman, and Brother Members of the League:

The sad event which calls us together so overwhelms me with sorrow that it is with feelings of the greatest hesitancy that I arise to add my humble tribute to the memory of the deceased, because I knew him well, and he was my friend.

Less than forty-eight hours ago we were gathered about the festive board, partaking of our annual banquet and enjoying to the fullest extent the festivities common to such an occasion. How changed is the scene tonight! The echo of friendly greeting, sweet music and song is scarcely hushed to our ears, the palative impressions left by that bounteous feast are still lingering on our lips, yet we find ourselves tonight called together to give some faint public expression to our feelings over the death of one who, in life, was most highly esteemed and respected, and who, in death, will be mourned, yet ever fondly mentioned by all who were fortunate as to have known him. 

Death is so common, it is such a constant companion to mankind, that, with rare exceptions, we pay no more attention to it than to the accustomed change from day to night. We hear of the death of this or that individual in our community, we pick up our newspaper and read of the taking off of this or that prominent personage, but no impressions are left with us, because in the busy hum-drum and bustle of life we do not give such announcements more than passing notice.

But when death lays its icy hands on one who was great among men; when, as on this occasion, it walks into our midst and with its fatal arrow fells at our very feet one who was a giant among us in all that goes to make the perfect man, one who was loved and respected by a whole community, who had, by his marked ability as a political leader and his unselfish services to his chosen party, endeared himself to his state, we pause, with uncovered heads and welling hearts, in death's awful presence, pondering over the great mystery with which it shrouds the world. 

Aside from the feelings of personal loss, what speculative thoughts come over us when we are brought face to face with death! Which of us will be the next to go? How soon will we, too, be called? What awaits us beyond the grave? 

Death, at any me, no matter who nay be its victim, is more or less appalling, and leaves some degree of sorrow in its wake. In the whole range of human experience there is scarcely an occasion when the soul, bursting its earthly habitation, and, soaring upward, passes through the mysterious vail, which separates us from that future, the secrets of which have never yet been unfolded to our doubting, hoping, puzzled minds, but what some heart is saddened, some person made to mourn. It often makes itself manifest when and where least expected, and, indeed, as in the present instance, least welcome, and again it frequently delays its looked-for blow, when, to the disinterested observer, it would seem a great boon to many whom we see suffering about us, to Whom life must necessarily have become a burden by reason of long lingering disease, incurable disabilities or helpless old age. 

Death gives no definite warning of its coming, yet we know that we must all sooner or later surrender to its icy embrace, and when it comes it ts unrelenting. It shows no partiality, it gives it victim no quarter,—grants him no time for preparation. Riches robes and all the luxuries of life receive no more respect from it than poverty and rags. Young and vigorous men like those assembled here, just entering on a career in life about the success of which there can be no question or shadow of doubts possessed in the fullest degree of every faculty, and with talents and accomplishments of the brightest promise—succumb to the fatal touch as easily, and almost as frequently, as those who, like him whose death we mourn tonight, have crossed the meridian of life marched down the western slope, and are there sojourning among the foot-hills in the complete enjoyment of the fruits of a life well spent. 

There are, as I have intimated, occasions when death does not seem sad, particularly to those who are not immediately interested in the person who is taken away. When a man, after battling with the world for three or four score years, retires from the active duties of life, and looking back over the past can truthfully say, I have done all the good I could for mankind; I have, to the best of my ability, performed all the requirements of my position among men,’’—when such a man,with his faculties declining and his body growing weak and weary with age, finally slumbers in the peaceful swoon of death—that death is not sad. For experience has taught us that such is the proper ending of all earthly existence; and our own hopes and desires, the longing of our very souls, in spite of all our doubting, teach us that such an ending of our existence here is only the beginning of a much happier and more perfect existence hereafter—an existence in which we fervently hope to be forever united with the friends and loved ones who have gone before. 

But when Divine Providences sees fit, as on this occasion, to tithe from our midst one who was still in the full vigor of all his faculties; one to whom so many still hoped to look for counsel, assistance and advice on matters of the greatest importance, politically and otherwise for many years to come; one who was surrounded by a loving and affectionate family, now so sadly bereaved by his untimely death; one who had, by his frugal industry, marked honesty, and honorable dealings with his fellow-men, accumulated a goodly portion of this world’s wealth, and was the happy possessor of an ideal home, and had everything about him to make his approaching old age happy and comfortable; who had, by his kindness of heart and his sociable disposition, endeared himself so universally to his friends and fellowmen,—such a taking-off is indeed sad, because it seems to us so untimely, and while we bow in sorrowful submission to the Power that thus takes him from us, we are, in our ignorance, almost tempted to question the wisdom of such a decree, 

It was my pleasure and good fortune to know MR. WARREN intimately and well for the past six years, and when I come to speak of him personally words fail me, and become utterly inadequate to give true expression to the feelings that swell my heart. On his death I have lost one of the best friends I ever had, and I feel that that is gone from me forever which can never be replaced. He was about the only person I knew here when I came to Buffalo, and he always seemed to take great pleasure in introducing me among his friends and extending my acquaintance here whenever and whenever opportunity permitted it. I never asked him for a favor that he did not gladly grant, and I have always observed, as in my own case, that when he did any thing for any one there was nothing selfish in his action, always leaving the impression that it was a pleasure for him to extend any courtesy in his power. 

He had one marked characteristic which I have observed, and that was that, with possibly very few exceptions, his strongest friendships were with men much younger than himself in years. Vigorous and robust in constitution, well preserved and free from dissipation, he felt young himself; and I know that many of the most pleasant hours of his life were spent in the company of his young friends. And it is not very improper to note that many of the most intimate of these young friends were democrats. For several years it has been customary with him on election day to give a dinner to about ten of his young friends in his own ward, and the boys have been accustomed to look forward with much pleasure to that annual dinner. It was my good fortune to be added to this list five or six years ago. Last election day, when we assembled at the accustomed place to partake of our election dinner, “Uncle Jim,” as the boys called him, was not there. Although none of us then realized that his illness which kept him from us would terminate fatally, yet no one who was present will ever forget the many kind feelings of sympathy and regret there expressed for him. Yes, he was pre-eminently a friend of the young men, and, outside of his immediate family circle, none will mourn his untimely death more than that circle of young men who have spent so many happy hours in his company. 

As a political leader and counsellor in the ranks of the republican party he will be greatly missed. The republican party has lost in him one of its best and ablest men, and in Erie county as well as the whole State of New York will suffer for his death for many years to come. 

During the arduous campaign of 1884, MR. WARREN'S efforts as chairman of our state committee, Were untiring. He labored zealously both day and night during the whole campaign, and I have been often told by those in a position to know, that had his counsels been follow in more instances by the national committee the election would have resulted differently. 

I, together with many of his friends, firmly believe that the great strain upon his constitution from his over work in that capacity sowed the seeds of disease which resulted in his dissolution. I believe that he cut off many years of his life in thus serving the republican party, and it is highly fitting that we, as young republicans on whom will now devolve a great share in that party work which he has been compelled by death to surrender, adopt the memorial just read as a faint token of the respect and esteem in which we held our deceased chieftain. The last act he ever did outside of his house was to vote the straight republican ticket last election day on being carried to the polls from the bed on which he breathed his last at half past eight o’clock last night. 

We, as citizens of Buffalo, in common with all our fellow-citizens, deeply deplore his loss, because we realize that when his heart ceased to beat one of our foremost citizens was taken from us.

We, as republicans, together with all those of our party faith, while acknowledging and commemorating his great services to our party, feel that we have lost a leader whom we have followed to many victories, and who has always been true to the cause in which he was enlisted.

And we, who were his intimate friends, while sadly mourning his sudden departure from us, and realizing that we have lost a friend whose friendship cannot be replaced, find much consolation in the thought that there will ever be a fresh green spot in our memories recalling that pleasant friendship which death cannot efface. Of him we truly say that

"Tho' the brows of tomorrow be radiant and bright,

"With love and with beauty, with life and with light,

"The dead heart of yesterday, cold on the bier,

"To the hearts that survive it, is ever more dear."

The memorial was unanimously adopted and on motion the house committee was instructed to drape the rooms of the leave in mourning for 30 days.

Upon motion a committee of active and honorary members, of which President Letchworth is chairman, was appointed to represent the league at the funeral of the deceased. All members of the league are invited to join the committee at the rooms of the league at 1.30 o'clock this afternoon. With the chairman, the members of the committee are:

S. Cary Adams, Phiio D. Beard, N.C. Barnum, Philip Becker, Alexander Brush, Emory P. Close, F. S. Crego, Frank S. Coit, James Crate, F. L. Danforth, W. C. Francis, F.C. Ferguson John C.

Laycock, J.G, Haffa, J. M. Provost. 

ACTION OF MEMBERS OF THE PRESS. 

A largely-attended meeting of members of the press was held Saturday evening at the rooms of the Press Club, to take action on the death of MR. WARREN. President McIntosh called the meeting to order, briefly stating its purpose, and saying that it seemed proper though MR. WARREN had not been a member of that club, that the body take some action on his decease. 

On motion of Mr. George Ferris, the Rev. Father Cronin was called to the chair, on assuming which he spoke as follows: 

“GENTLEMEN—I should regard myself guilty pf culpable neglect in the performance of a solemn and melancholy duty did I fail to unite With you tonight in paying a suitable tribute to the memory of JAMES D. WARREN. 

“Alas! that in moments such as these the tongue should be weak to express what the heart so strongly feels. 

“I have been profoundly impressed with the announcement of MR. WARREN'S death. 

“Like a towering forest oak stricken by unexpected lightning from a summer sky, so comes the merciless arrow of the inevitable destroyer to one who indeed towered aloft above the crowd, not only by his commanding presence and superb physique, but by his strong personality and far reaching influence as well.

“Reflecting upon the all too untimely death of MR. WARREN—snatched away in the midst of his vigor, his usefulness, his power and his fame, who can help exclaiming to himself at least: And what is it all When all is done! It seems like the sudden dropping of the curtain and the quenching of the lights ere the play 1s half over. 

“I am aware indeed how utterly vain is spoken praise to ‘the dull cold ear of death.’ But we owe it to the living, we owe it to our city, we owe it to the state, aye, We owe It to the nation to record our estimate of MR. WARREN'S rare worth, ere his remains he consigned to their final rest, 

“I shall not now dwell on the varied aspects of his long and useful career. That has been done today by kindly pens in our city press; and the story of the dead journalist's life will be rehearsed throughout the land. 

“He was no child of enervating fortune. Like nearly all our great men, MR. WARREN sprang from the people; and all his manhood years were with the people and for them. And if those years were crowned with signal success—with large wealth and commanding influence—that success was achieved by resourceful brain, tireless labor and high endeavor. I have long regarded MR. WARREN as a typical American. Simple in his tastes, strong in convictions, vigorous in upholding them, he was warm as a friend and honorable as a foe; and while feeling himself the equal of any, he stooped to the lowly with an affability that won their hearts. 

“Such is the Impression left upon me during my occasional intercourse with the distinguished dead. 

“In his demise, Buffalo loses one of her foremost citizens, his party a sage in council and a hero in battle, his friends a man of whose regard they had reason to be proud, and the people of whatever condition, one whose sympathy was theirs and upon whose word they could rely. 

“I am glad to state that my acquaintance with MR. WARREN was of the pleasantest character; and now that be is gone, I only wish I could pierce the desolation that enshrouds his lately happy home with some ray of sunshine, while joining you gentlemen in weaving for the memory of the illustrious dead a heart-wreath of immortelles.” 

F. F. Fargo said he too had felt profoundly the shock of the sudden news which reached him that morning regarding the death of their distinguished friend and fellow citizen. MR. WARREN was no ordinary man, and in honoring him there were honoring themselves. Although not a journalist in the strictest sense of the word, MR. WARREN was a publicist of large experience and extended knowledge. After spending most of the years of his mature life at newspaper work he had come to occupy a proud position in the front rank, it might be said, among the journalists of the country. His influence and knowledge of men and affairs were not by any means limited to Buffalo. He was known and respected throughout the state and nation, and the death of such a man was a public calamity. Having thus been stricken down in the very prime of his manhood, his place in Buffalo would not be easily filled. The speaker moved the appointment of a committee of five to draft suitable resolutions. Carried, and the chair appointed Messrs. F. F. Fargo, William McIntosh, Norman E. Mack, Matthias Rohr, and Arthur W. Austin. 

While the committee was making its report, Mr. R. C. Hill took occasion to add a few words, saying that his experiences with and reminiscences of MR. WARREN were most satisfactory. He deplored the loss of one so respected, and one who so ably represented the journalistic profession in Buffalo. He hoped a general expression of the entire press, irrespective of club membership, would be obtained, as he was sure the whole press united in regretting the loss of this respected member. P 

Mr. Ambrose Butler took occasion to say that he was not personally acquainted with MR. WARREN, but his brother had known him well. He had just received a telegram from Mr. E. H, Butler saying that he deeply regretted the death of MR. WARREN, and united in paying a tribute to his memory. 

Chairman Fargo then reported the following resolutions, which were unanimously adopted, as the sentiment of the meeting: 

The death of JAMES D. WARREN in the fullness and vigor of manhood is an incalculable loss to the city, the state and the nation. His influence and usefulness were not limited to municipal locality, but were felt throughout the commonwealth, even extending to the boundaries of the Union itself. 

Cast in a large mold, MR. WARREN instinctively took a broad and comprehensive view of affairs, and was readily recognized by his fellows as a leader of men. He was proverbially modest, never preferring nor urging his own claims or merits, but rather promoting those of others often less meritorious than his own. 

MR. WARREN was a manly man. Always dignified and courteous, never trifling nor demeaning himself, he therefore commanded the respect of all classes of men. In society, business and political affairs he occupied a place in the front rank and the place was not only occupied but filled. His knowledge of men and affairs seemed intuitive, his judgment as unerring as is possible for human opinions to be, and his integrity was without a blemish. His private life was without a reproach and his death is an almost unbearable bereavement to his afflicted family. 

The Press Club, speaking for itself and the press of the city of Buffalo, feel it an honor to place this brief testimonial upon the bier of one who has added lustre to the profession of which it is a representative. 

Resolved, That the members of the club will attend the obsequies of MR. WARREN in a body, and invite members of the press generally to join them. 

Resolved, That an engrossed copy of the foregoing, attested by the officers of the club, be presented to the family of the deceased. 

The resolutions as first read were indicative only of regret on the part of the Press Club, but on motion of Mr. R. C. Hill, the words "and the press of the city of Buffalo” were interpolated, and they were thus adopted. 

Mr. Leslie Thom paid a tribute to the memory of MR. WARREN, saying that he deeply regretted the loss of a man whom he had known personally and who had made a deep and abiding impression upon the affairs of the city, while at the same time he took a melancholy pleasure in thus giving utterance to the regard for the deceased. 

Mr. Matthias Rohr gave voice to the sentiments of respect concerning the loss to the community of a man who was so great a figure in it, and whom he had known so well. 

Arthur W. Austin said the sentiments of the entire staff of the COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER had been so well set forth in a brief editorial contained in the paper of that evening, that any further words from him would be superfluous. They all felt they had lost a true, kind, steadfast friend, one who had always been considerate in his treatment of his employes, ever ready to overlook failings and prompt to commend what he deemed commendable.

Mr. Fargo moved that as the resolutions provided that the press should attend in a body, that a committee of arrangements be appointed by the chair to provide for this, and the following committee was named: 

Messrs. F. F. Fargo, George Bleistein, George M. Hausauer, E. H. Butler, Eugene Fleury, Norman E. Mack. 

The meeting then adjourned.

ACTION OF WHITE'S BANK. 

A meeting of the directors of White's Bank of Buffalo, of which MR. WARREN was president, was held on Saturday afternoon. The following memorial, presented by the Hon. Nelson K. Hopkins, was unanimously adopted.

We have heard with profound regret and sorrow of the death of the Hon. JAMES D.WARREN the President of this bank, with whom we have been pleasantly associated for many years. He was an able and accomplished man of business, a warm and devoted friend, and an agreeable companion. He has been called to many important and responsible positions in life, and he has filled them all with honor and credit.

Resolved, That in death of MR. WARREN this bank has lost a wise, honest and indefatigable officer, who has always had its success and prosperity at heart; that we individually have lost a valued friend, the bank a safe counselor, and this community a highly-esteemed and worthy citizen. 

Resolved, That we extend to the family of the deceased our sympathy in its bereavement; that out of respect to his memory this bank be draped in mourning for thirty days, and that this board attend the funeral in a body. 

Resolved, That these resolutions be entered in the minutes, and a copy he sent to the family of the deceased, and published in the daily papers of the city. 

ACTION OF FIFTH WARD REPUBLICANS. 

At a meeting of the Fifth ward republican committee Saturday evening the following resolution was adopted: 

The Fifth ward republican committee desire to add expressions commemorative of the esteem and regard with which we have at all times looked upon JAMES D. WARREN. As a leading republican in Western New York, and especially in Erie county, his counsel and advice, it has seemed to us, were such that they could be relied upon as being safe, prudent, and politic, and it was always with feelings of assurance and success that his wise counsel and advice were received. Truly the republican party in the county of Erie has lost an able and staunch leader in the person of MR. WARREN. His private life, genial, whole-souled disposition are known to all who knew him, and those who were privileged to know him intimately can best testify to his honorable manhood and his deep anxiety for the success of his friends or anyone in whom he became interested, and to the value of his wisdom and counsel. We extremely regret his untimely death and our sympathy is with those who knew him better and those who loved him best. 

ACTION OF CITY AND COUNTY OFFICIALS. 

At a meeting of the officials of the City and County, irrespective of party, held at Mayor Becker’s office at 11 o'clock today the following memorial and resolution was unanimously adopted: 

We, the officials and employees of the city and county, were extremely grieved upon learning of the death of our esteemed fellow citizen JAMES D. WARREN; and moved by a common impulse and appreciation of the great loss thus sustained, have come together to express our sorrow and pay our humble tribute of respect to the distinguished dead. 

By his breadth of intellect, his liberal views, his indefatigable enterprise and his untiring devotion to the welfare of our city for upwards of thirty years, he contributed largely to its growth and prosperity. 

By his truthfulness, honesty, integrity and superior business ability and tact, he was remarkably successful, winning the confidence and esteem of all, and was justly regarded as the soul of commercial honor. 

By his noble character and high moral standard, combined with rare talent, he did inestimable good in elevating the character and tone of the Press, and by furnishing our people with a pure and able journal. 

Endowed with an affable manner, a generous heart, and an affection for his friends, by the aid of his almost perfect knowledge of human nature, coupled with a superior judgment and strong political conviction, he early became a leader in his party, and was long prominent in its councils throughout the state and nation. 

His noble character and upright life which were crowned with deserved success, have met the approval of multitude of bereaved fellow-countrymen, and are worthy the emulation of all. 

Resolved, That this testimonial be furnished the Press, and an engrossed copy be transmitted to the grief-stricken family, and that we attend the funeral.
