  - From the Cleveland Museum of Art: "Set in rural Long Island before the Civil War, this scene of an African American laborer eavesdropping on a fiddle tune suggests the divisive race relations in America at the time. While a love of music connects the men and acknowledges their common humanity, they nevertheless occupy different spaces. The barn door that separates the laborer likely serves as a symbolic reminder that he lacked the political rights and social privileges of the group of white men inside."
   
  - From Arader Galleries: "Mount was distinguished from his fellow American artists, however, by one crucial factor. Unlike many who followed in his footsteps, he had a heightened sense of empathy towards African Americans. While many of his contemporaries depicted them as caricatures, Mount imbued them instead with natural grace and dignity. Although his treatments hardly represented unmitigated reality, they were nonetheless significantly more perceptive and multifaceted than the patronizing, one-sided cartoon figures that became the stock-in-trade of artists and firms like Currier &amp; Ives. His works emphatically should be judged by the standards of his time; although today they still might appear paternalistic in their attitudes towards African Americans, in the mid-19th century they as far from black-face as visual imagery ever was."
