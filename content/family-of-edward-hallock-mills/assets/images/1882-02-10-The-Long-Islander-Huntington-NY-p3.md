    - Obviously, there is an entire line of vital information obscured, but I have done my best to fill in the data based on what is known from other sources. The most important detail is obviously the date of birth: “May” is clear, but the rest is open to interpretation. Fortunately, if one subtracts “86 years, 8 months and 28 days” from 30 Jan 1882, one does arrive at precisely 02 May 1795, corroborating the genealogical records cited. (Assuming of course, that this obituary is not the original source used by the genealogies.)
    
    - The notice references prior publication in the Hempstead Sentinel, so there is some chance of finding more legible text. I have yet to locate issues of the Hempstead Sentinel from this time period. Also note that Hempstead is therefore the place referred to as "this village".

    - The relative time reference “Monday evening of last week” is 30 Jan 1882, corroborating the genealogical records cited. 

    - According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Square,_New_York): "Franklin Square is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in Nassau County, New York, United States. The hamlet is an unincorporated area in the Town of Hempstead. ...The area was originally known as Trimming Square and then as Washington Square. ...It is rumored that the original name for the area, Trimming Square, reflected the fact that farms once dominated the area's landscape (as was common for areas all across the Hempstead Plains), and because many sheep were brought to the area by local farmers for separation during the latter parts of the 18th Century. The Trimming Square name was used between the early 19th Century and 1851, when the name was changed to Washington Square after George Washington. The name of the community was again changed in the 1870s when locals made strides to establish a local U.S. post office. The United States Postal Service would not use the name Washington Square, as they felt that there were too many other places within New York which had Washington in their names. This led to locals again changing the name, and they ultimately chose the name Franklin Square. It is rumored that the name is in honor of Benjamin Franklin."

—On Monday evening of last week one of the old residents of Hempstead died. Mr. Jonas D. Mills, who was born at Stony Brook, [Suffolk County?], May [unclear day and year], making him at the time of his death, 86 years, 8 months, and 28 days old. In his young days he learned the wheelwright trade, which at that time included the undertaking business. He subsequently took up farming in Queens County, but for the past 30 years he has not been actively engaged in business. He was married twice, and had two daughters and three sons, the latter still living—Edward H., J. Thomas, and Robert S. Mills. He came to this town about 1838, locating at Trimming (now Franklin) Square; in 1837 he came to this village, where he has ever since resided, with the exception of a few years. He always enjoyed good health, never needing a physician, and died of old age. 

—Hempstead Sentinel

Mr. Mills was the father of J. Thomas Mills of Huntington.
