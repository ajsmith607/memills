    - Here, it seems that Emily was using an opportunity to publicize her store instead of "M. Emily Mills" or "Emily Mills" as she normally referred to herself. E. D. Shurter, Charles and Anna Mulks, as well as Jessie (Shurter) and Lewis Brewer are among those mentioned.

    - A close reading suggests that the "Caroline resident" quoted is E. D. Shurter, and in fact, the style of the entire article is uncharacteristic of a Journal reporter and reads more like a press release the Professor wrote for the Journal.

**Grateful Town of Caroline Places Marker in Memory of Lockwood, Rural Doctor**

The people of Caroline have honored the memory of Dr. Benjamin F. Lockwood, for 26 years a country practitioner.

With formal ceremony, a bronze tablet has been affixed to a granite boulder which Doctor Lockwood himself placed in front of his Dalebrook apartments in Brooktondale.

The movement to honor the man who "combined in himself the functions of minister, physician, lawyer, counsellor and friend," was initiated by the Caroline Town Council. For 26 years, in the words of one Caroline resident, Doctor Lockwood "day after day drove over the dusty roads of summer and through the snow banks of winter, answered calls by day or night, visited patients on sick beds and death beds, and ministered to the ailments of hundreds in the Town of Caroline who survive him and hold him in grateful remembrance."

The tablet bears the following inscription:

---

Dr. BENJAMIN F. LOCKWOOD

(1862-1934)

In grateful appreciation of his faithful services during a period of twenty-six years to the people of the Town of Caroline.
