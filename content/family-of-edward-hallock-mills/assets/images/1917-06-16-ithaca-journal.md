  - [Julia E. Reed](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/96968839/julia-e-reed) (1846 to 25 Aug 1916). "Miss Julia Reed, who has ben [sic] ill for several weeks of heart trouble, died at her home in Brookon Friday evening, August 25. Miss Reed lived the greater part of her life in this neighborhood and is a member of the Central Chapel Church. Because of her kindly and charitable disposition she leaves an unusually large circle of friends who will miss her greatly." (01 Sep 1916, The Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p7.) "
  The funeral of Miss Julia E. Reed was very largely attended from the home of Mr. and Mrs. Melvin Lynch Monday at 2 p.m. ... Mrs. Sarah Leonard spent last week at Melvin Lynch's helping to care for her sister Miss Julia Reed." (30 Aug 1916, The Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p7.)

  - Ann J. Irey (? to 28 May 1917). "Mrs. J. B. Irey suffered a very severe shock of paralysis and is now in a critical condition." (13 Feb 1917, The Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p7.) George Jansen, in his 1917 journal, gives regular accounts of Mrs. Irey's condition in her final weeks (she "has got a shock" as he put it), including her last night. 07 Apr 1917 is typical: "Mrs. Irey howled all night". And her final day, 28 May 1917: "I sat up all night with Mrs. Irey so Emeline could have a little rest. I expect her to breathe her last any minute. Respiration 30 a minute 2AM. Mrs. Irey died 1:30 PM today." The next day, 29 May 1917: "Digging Mrs. Irey grave today." 30 May 1917: "Mrs. Irey funeral today."
