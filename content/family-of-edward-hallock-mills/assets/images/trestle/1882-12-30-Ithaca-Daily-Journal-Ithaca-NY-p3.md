LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.

A CHANGE OF NAME. 

To the Editor of the Journal, 

The people of Motts Corners have decided on a change of name and have pitched upon Bridgeton. Did you ever? Of all names hard to pronounce and hard to spell! And if anything about that locality should be suppressed from the vocabulary it is that bridge, which is ugly enough in appearance and a terror to travellers. The structure must disappear in time but the name it seems is to be perpetuated. We understand the name of Brookside received a strong supportâ€”and a prettier name was never spoken; but there 1s no accounting for tastes. We congratulate our neighbors up on getting out of the frying-pan into BRIDGETON,
