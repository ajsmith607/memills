AN OVERCOAT STOLEN. 

An overcoat valued at $18.50 was stolen Saturday evening from a form in front of Ben Mintz’s clothing store. Mr. Mintz suspected the thief to be one of a party of men employed on the Brookton bridge who were in town Saturday afternoon and evening. The merchant went to Brookton yesterday and endeavored to procure a search warrant but was unable to obtain the document and the suspect left town before he could get the machinery of the law in operation. 

BROOKTON’S BRIDGE.

The great iron bridge at Brookton on the E. C. & N, used up 840,000 pounds of iron, which was put in place in less than four weeks of working time. It will be completed and painted by Thursday of next week. The heaviest piece of iron used in the structure is a girder weighing 750 pounds. Cofrode & Saylor of Philadelphia, were the builders, their extensive bridge shops being at Pottstown, Pa. The firm also put up the stone piers. The trestle needs a little filling by the railroad company along the west approach to the bridge to finish the splendid work of engineering. During the time of putting up the bridge there has been no delay to the passage of a single train and not the least accident has occurred. The wooden timbers removed cover a ten acre lot.
