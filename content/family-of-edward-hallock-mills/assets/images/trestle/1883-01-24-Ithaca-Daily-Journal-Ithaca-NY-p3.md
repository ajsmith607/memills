**MOTT’S CORNERS NO MORE.**

**The Hamlet Re-christened.** 

On December 27th a public meeting was held at Mott’s Corners of the people receiving mail at that post office, and by a unanimous vote of ninety-six legal voters it was decided to petition the post office department to change the name of Mott’s Corners to Bridgeton. This appeat was made: 

1st—Because the name of the place was very frequently confounded with Mottville, in Onondaga county, and mail intended for Mott's Corners was often miscarried. There is but one Mottville in this state; but so many persons have insisted upon two that interminable confusion and delay prevailed and the lot of two post masters was truly not a happy one. 

2d—Bridgeton was deemed a pretty name, and an appropriate One too, because within the limits of the hamlet there are the great rail road bridge, four town bridges and Mr. Mandeville's iron bridge. 

The department ruled that good cause was shown for change of name, but rejected the one chosen, having found that in the 46,000 post offices in this country the name Bridgeton occurred once down in New Jersey. The abbreviations of the state names “N, Y.,” and “N. J.,” when carelessly written might again lead to confusion, and this it was deemed desirable to avoid. 

A second meeting was held on the 17th instant and a choice debated Some favored “Brookside” and others still urged Bridgeton. There being other Brooksides in this state a happy compromise was effected by taking the head of one and joining it on to the tail of the other and the department was notified that the popular second choice was “Brookton.” On the 19th instant Postmaster Personius received official notice that after the current quarter “Motts Corners” would be no more, and that “Brookton” would rise from its hashes—speaking figuratively.  

So, after April 1883, and for one year thereafter, both the old and new names will be carried into the “Postal Guides” and thereafter the new name only will be officially recognized. The change compels a new bond, oath of office, commission cancelling stamps, etc., etc., the same as in the establishment of a new Office. 

The comical side of this event—few events being without their ludicrous features—is that at this late day a few of the “old-fashioned” residents are circulating a “remonstrance” on the backhills and want to retain the good old name of Motts Corners.

It is fitting as a conclusion to notice that in the postal guide, railroad time tables and by sensible people generally the word “Depot” is now omitted from “Bessemer’s Depot” and “Bessemer” stands out boldly alone and officially from this time on. “Courteous and: gentle readers” govern yourselves accordingly.
