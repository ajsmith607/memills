  - The envelope is addressed to [Dr. Fowler Bradnack](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/166430543/fowler-bradnack) (1842 to 1891), the son of [Reverend Isaac R. Bradnack](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/166430500/isaac-r-bradnack) (1813 to 1897) who was pastor of Brookton Congregational Church from 1885 to 1887. Reverend Bradnack's name is mis-transcribed as "Bradnae" in both Amy Atwater's Centennial Celebration book and the 150th Anniversary Handbook that reprints the earlier error.
