  - As mentioned in a newspaper clipping above, Dr. Lockwood and his wife lived for a time in the apartment above M. E. Mills while his house was being "reconstructed" from May 1 to late October, 1926.

Brooktondale looked much like this, with a few more trees, when I was small. (This photo was taken about 1915). The building at the far left was Mills' store when I was in grade school. Dr. Lockwood house, which he had remodeled some was next door. Miss Mills lived in the house at the right. She also taught Sunday School and played the organ or piano in the Congregational Church. The trestle is in the middle background. Beyond Dr. Lockwood house was Charles and Annie Mulks, and then a meat market, at other times a barbershop.
