ACCIDENTS AT BROOKTON. 

During the fireworks at Brookton Saturday evening George Richardson, a prominent merchant of that village, sustained injuries through the explosion of a heavy, piece which laid open his scalp, and will probably cause partial blindness in the left eye. 

Mr. Richardson was in charge of the fireworks display, which was held at about eight o'clock. While lighting the fuse of a large bomb, the piece exploded while he was still bending over it and he was struck a glancing blow by the contents just above the bridge of the nose. 

The powder was driven into his face and eyes, and a deep gash nearly two inches in length and about half an inch wide was torn across his forehead and into his scalp. Drs. Charles Gallagher, of Slaterville, and Carl Denman, of Danby, relieved the eyes of a part of the powder Sunday morning, and it was thought that the sight of the right eye could be saved entirely, while the left might be considerably impaired. The glancing blow of the bombâ€™s charge, the physicians state, saved his life, for had he been struck squarely, death would have been the inevitable result.  

During the field events of the afternoon, a little child, the daughter of Elmer Stephens, of that place, was knocked down and run over by a cyclist. The child was badly bruised.
