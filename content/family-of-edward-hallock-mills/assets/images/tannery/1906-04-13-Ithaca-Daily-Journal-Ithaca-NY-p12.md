CAROLINE.

An "At Home" at School–Death of Mrs. Esther Salisbery.

Caroline, April 9.

A number of the parents and friends of the school children accepted the invitation of the teacher, Mrs. B. M. Roe, and were present Friday afternoon when the children had exercises consisting of singing, recitations and reading. 

The children did well and were all well entertained. Edward Foote, an aged resident gave a short talk and told the children of his school days; described the old fireplace stove, built in the center of the room, the raised platform with desk and benches running around three sides of the room, the goosequill pen, etc., which was listened to with much interest.

Mrs. Roe said while they were always at home, and glad to see visitors and to have them show their interest in the school, that every two weeks on Friday afternoon was their special “at Home” and all were invited.

AN AGED RESIDENT OF CAROLINE DIES

Mrs. Esther Salisbury died Saturday morning, April 7th, aged 82 years. She was born in Connecticut and came with her parents to Oswego county, when a child. Her maiden name was Alton. At the age of 27 she married Enos Salisbury, who for many years was a deacon of the Baptist Church at Sandy Creek. They were very active in all church work.

Since the death of her husband several years ago she had spent most of her time here with her sister, Mrs. Louise Salisbury, and her niece, Mrs. Judson Rounseville and Miss Clara Salisbury.

She retained her faculties to a remarkable degree and was able to do light housework and fine needle work until her last illness. Her many relatives and friends have the memory of a long life well spent to comfort them. One sister, Mrs. Louise Salisbury and one brother, Wm. Alton, who has spent the winter in Mexico, but is now in Scranton, Pa., survive her. Mr. and Mrs. Judson Rounseville and Mrs. Louise Salisbury accompanied the remains to Sandy Creek, Oswego county, on Monday, where the funeral was held in the Baptist Church and she was laid to rest beside her husband.

Mrs. Francis Earsley is gaining slowly.

Miss Louise Rounseville returned to Cortland Monday to resume her studies in the High School.

Mrs. Nora Bothwick, who has been spending the winter in Cortland, returned to her home on Thursday.

Mrs. Byron Jenks, of Owego, came Sunday night to spend a few days with her daugther, Mrs. W. W. Conrad.

Fred Anderson, who has been spending a couple of weeks at the home of Miss Clara Salisbury and Judson Rounseville, went on Monday to resume his studies at Madison University, at Hamilton.
