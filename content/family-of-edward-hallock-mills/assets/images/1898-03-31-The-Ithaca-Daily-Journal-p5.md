    - "At one time, a King’s Daughters organization existed. In 1898, they proposed to buy a furnace and put it in running order. No doubt they did so; notes are few on their activities."  — *History of the Congregational Church, Brooktondale, New York.* Compiled and edited by Mrs. Amy Atwater on the occasion of The Centennial Celebration of the Caroline Valley Federated Church, Brooktondale, New York, June 16th, 1968. Used with permission from Caroline Valley Community Church.

    - Brooktondale's name changed from Mott's Corners to Brookton in April 1883, but Brookton was a compromise: "Some favored "Brookside" and others still urged Bridgeton. There being other Brooksides in this state a happy compromise was effected by taking the head of one and joining it onto the tail of the other and the department was notified that a popular second choide was "Brookton." (24 Jan 1883, Ithaca Daily Journal, Ithaca NY, p3.) Apparently even years later, some still preferred Brookside.
