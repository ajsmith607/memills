notes: 'From the Library of Congress: "Significance: The Mills Pond House is the nucleus of a small rural hamlet settled and long inhabited by the Mills family. This area provides an unusual survival of a small agricultural community once common on Long Island. The prosperity of the Mills family is evident from this substantial Greek Revival house built for William Wickham Mills in 1838-40. Designed by New York City architect, Calvin Pollard, the house is one of the few high-style structures of this period on Long Island. The extensive original documentation which remains in a family collection provides an unusually complete picture of the construction of a mid 19th century house."'
