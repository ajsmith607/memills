TWO STATE TROOPERS INSTANTLY KILLED AS CAR OVERTURNS 

Arthur A. Reddy, 27, of 14 Park Place, and Gerald Kane, 29, of Brooklyn, Die In Auto Accident. 

Two accidents in the general vicinity of Huntington resulted in two deaths and the very serious injury of a third person on Monday. The two men killed were State Troopers Arthur Reddy, of Park Place, just off Clinton Place, Huntington, and Jerry Kane, who was at one time connected with the Huntington Barracks of the State Troopers. 

The injured person was Mrs. Grace Fairman of Church Street, Northport, wife of David Fairman, attorney in W. B. Codling’s office at Northport. 

The Troopers were killed instantly on Main Street, near Wyandanch. This is a highway which parallels the motor parkway, from Lower Melville to Wyandanch village. Their car skidded on the wet pavement about noon and overturned, pinning them under the wreckage. 

Dr. George T. McMurray of Farmingdale, who was summoned to the scene of the accident, pronounced both dead. The bodies were removed to the J. Henry Daily Funeral Home, Babylon, and later shipped to their respective homes. 

Trooper Gerald Kane was 29 years old, and had been in the service for five years. He was the son of Mr. and Mrs. John A. Kane of 320 Fourth Street, Brooklyn. Besides his parents, he is survived by two brothers, Joseph B. Kane and Edmunde Kane, and two sisters, Muriel V. Kane and Mrs. Grace Brunner. His father is employed in the Corporation Counsel’s office, New York. Funeral services were held Thursday morning in the Immaculate Heart of Mary R. C. Church, Brooklyn. Interment followed in Holy Cross Cemetery. 

Trooper Arthur A. Reddy, 27, is the son of William Reddy. Besides his father and stepmother, he leaves his widow, Mrs, Florence Schuh Reddy, and a 22-year-old daughter, Barbara. 

Mrs. Fairman, about 30 years old, was seriously injured when thrown out of a car she was driving as it struck a tree off Route 25A between Huntington and Centerport. Her baby, who was being carried in a car cradle in the car, was also thrown out but escaped serious Injury. 

Sergeant Clarence Philips and Patrolman Bert O'Neil of the Huntington police, investigated the accident. Mrs. Fairman was thrown out when a door was forced open by the impact. She is in the Huntington Hospital suffering from a broken nose, compound fracture of the jaw, compound fracture of the leg, a brain concussion and a possible fracture of the skull. She is being treated by Dr. Cyril Drysdale.
