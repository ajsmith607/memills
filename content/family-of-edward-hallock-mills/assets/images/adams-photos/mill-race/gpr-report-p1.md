We appreciate the opportunity to provide this report for our work completed on June 29, 2023. 

PURPOSE 

The purpose of this project was to search for any signs of an old creek bed from an old mill that was referenced on old deed descriptions. Also to search for any signs of an old barn foundation, which was also referenced. The client walked through the area desired to be scanned. 

EQUIPMENT 

  - Underground Scanning GPR Antenna. The antenna with frequencies ranging from 250 MHz-450 MHz is mounted in a stroller frame which rolls over the surface. The surface needs to be reasonably smooth and unobstructed in order to obtain readable scans. Obstructions such as curbs, landscaping, and vegetation will limit the feasibility of GPR. The data is displayed on a screen and marked in the field in real time. The total depth achieved can be as much as 8’ or more with this antenna but can vary widely depending on the types of materials being scanned through. Some soil types such as clay may limit maximum depths to 3’ or less. As depth increases, targets must be larger in order to be detected and non-metallic targets can be especially difficult to locate. Depths provided should always be treated as estimates as their accuracy can be affected by multiple factors. For more information, please visit: Link 

  - GPS. This handheld GPS unit offers accuracy down to 4 inches; however, the accuracy will depend on the satellite environment and obstructions and should not be considered survey-grade. Features can be collected as points, lines, or areas and then exported into Google Earth or overlaid on a CAD drawing. For more information, please visit: Link 

PROCESS 

The process typically begins by using GPR scans in order to evaluate the data and calibrate the equipment. Based on these findings, a scanning strategy is formed, typically consisting of scanning the entire area in a grid with 2 ft scan spacing in order to locate any potential anomalies that may be possible remnants of a creek bed and/or foundation walls . The GPR data is viewed in real time and anomalies in the data are located and marked on the surface along with their depths using spray paint, pin flags, etc. Relevant scan examples were saved and will be provided in this report. 

LIMITATIONS 

Please keep in mind that there are limitations to any subsurface investigation. The equipment may not achieve maximum effectiveness due to soil conditions, above ground obstructions, reinforced concrete, and a variety of other factors. No subsurface investigation or equipment can provide a complete image of what lies below. Our results should always be used in conjunction with as many methods as possible including consulting existing plans and drawings, exploratory excavation or potholing, visual inspection of above-ground features, and utilization of services such as One Call/811. Depths are dependent on the dielectric of the materials being scanned so depth accuracy can vary throughout a site. Relevant scan examples were saved and will be provided in this report.
