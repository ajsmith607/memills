**COURT RECORD**

VERDICT FOR THE STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY.

...
The next case tried was that of Tompkins County vs. E. H. Mills. Edward H. Burdick for plaintiff, C. R. Wolcott for defendant. This was a case similar to the Beardsley case, an agent of the State Board of Pharmacy, purchasing poisonous drugs at the store of Mr. Mills in Brookton. In this case the jury took a different view of the matter and brought in a verdict of $50 in favor of the plaintiff.
