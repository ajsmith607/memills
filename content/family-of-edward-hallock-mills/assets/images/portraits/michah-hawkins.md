  - Description from Frick Library: "(a) Micah Hawkins (1777-1825), the uncle of the Mount brothers, was "the family 'genius,' composter and talented musician". He played several instruments, including the piano, one of which he had built under a counter in his grocery store in New York where he could use it "when not otherwise engaged." He ran a tavern in New York, painted, wrote poetry (volume printed in New York, 1824) and composed a successful (b) comic opera, "The Saw Mill or a Yankee Trick" of which the libretto, also published in 1824, is the only extant part. (c) The opera is an example of American genre. (a) he married Letty Lindy. (c) He guided and influenced his three nephews, teaching music especially to William who learned readily. (a) Inscription on back of portrait: "Portrait of/Micah Hawkins Esqr/Painted by Louis Child Esqr/Retouched from/memory by/Wm S. Mount/May 1856"."
