# notes: "I believe this is likely Laura (Love) Warren, James D. Warren's first wife and mother to Orsamus George Warren. I base this identification on what I perceive to be the resemblance to a labelled photo of Orsamus George Warren. There are also known photos of James' only other son, William Candee Warren–from his second marriage to Mary Mills–that would rule out the possibility that Orsamus George Warren had been misidentified in the referenced photo."
