Slippery roads cause crashes 

Five people were injured Sunday in two separate car accidents that occurred because of slippery road conditions, Tompkins County sheriff’s deputies said today: 

* NEWFIELD — A boy is in stable condition this morning and two other people were slightly injured about 2:30 p.m. in a head-on collision on Route 34 here, deputies said. 

Jeffrey T. Dubert, 29, of 127 Meadowbrook Court, told police he was driving south on Route 34 when he attempted to turn left into a private driveway and failed to see an oncoming car driven by Jack L. Hamilton, 42, of 119 Depot Road, because of heavy snowfall. 

Hamilton and Dubert were treated and released at Tompkins Community Hospital, a spokeswoman said this morning. Hamilton’s son, Dennis, 7, was admitted and is under observation today. 

Dubert was charged with failing to keep right and failing to wear a seat belt, deputies said. 

* CAROLINE — Two passengers in a vehicle were slightly injured about 9:40 a.m. in a two-car accident on Route 330, deputies said. 

Sylvia B. Short, 29, of 356 Central Chapel Road, Brooktondale, was driving south when she attempted to turn left into the driveway of Caroline Federated Church. Deputies said her vehicle was struck by a car driven by Lawrence E, Lattin, 45, of 475 Brooktondale Road, Brooktondale, who approached from the opposite direction but was unable to stop because of the icy road, 

Short’s two daughters, Sarah, 7, and Mary, 5, were treated for minor injuries and released from Tompkins Community Hospital, a spokeswoman said this morning. 

Lattin, his wife, Janet, and their four daughters in the vehicle were not injured in the mishap.
