Pop’s Place’s finale 

By JIM MYERS 

A last-ditch attempt to keep a Collegetown tradition alive ended up in city court this morning with two charges of trespass. 

Joseph Greer, 36, 111 First St., and Nancy Tresner, 25, 475 Brooktondale Rd., were arrested Saturday night after they attempted to keep Pop's Place, the College Avenue eatery, open for business, apparently in violation of a settlement made in City Court July 6. 

Greer and Ms. Tresner appeared before City Court Judge James J. Clynes Jr. this morning. The case was adjourned until July 25. 

In the earlier city court settlement between Student Agencies, owners of the building at 413-15 College Ave., and Lola Associates, a partnership that has run the restaurant since March, the premises were to have been vacated by 8 a. m. Saturday. 

But Greer, a previous manager of the restaurant, intends to claim a lease with Gary Gut, the building’s prior owner, is still valid. 

And Ms. Tresner, a member of Lola Assoc., said today she personally had never agreed to the arrangement made by the associates and Student Agencies. 

The two, with help from other workers, attempted to keep the business going Saturday, even though Lola Associates had officially disbanded. 

These charges are part of a lengthy dispute over operation of the restaurant, a Collegetown fixture since 1911. 

Student Agencies, a Cornell student-run corporation, bought the building May 19 — and decided to lease the premises for an A & W Root Beer outlet at $1600 a month — more than Lola Assoc. said they could pay. 

After several legal skirmishes, members of Lola Assoc. agreed to leave, and the group held a farewell party Friday night, attended by several hundred supporters. 

But after the party, Greer and Ms. Tresner kept the business going until police cleared the premises — and the doors were padlocked. 

Student Agencies reported today that the A & W franchise, headed by Jim Zifchock and Christopher Englert, took possession of the restaurant this morning and began work on renovations.
