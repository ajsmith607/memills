About Pop’s Place Editor, The Journal: 

As a long-time Ithaca resident, it never ceases to amaze me how an allegedly aware population cannot seem to recognize the demise of our city’s small businesses to the bottomless financial strength of national corporations who could care less about you or I or anyone but the dollar for that matter. I’m referring to the recent purchase of the Pop's Place building by Student Agencies and the subsequent eviction of the people who are members of a cooperative currently owning and managing the restaurant housed in that building. 

It seems to me that if the purpose of Student Agencies is to supply an atmosphere for Cornell students (the owners of Pop's are Cornell students or graduates for the most part) to practice “free enterprise” without getting plowed under by high rents and operating costs, the rental of the storefront to A&W Root Beer is not only incongruous but very obnoxious. 

Pop's is a good restaurant with homemade food and a very friendly environment. To see this establishment fall to a plastic fast-food chain which will probably die in a few years leaving its unsightly corpse sporting a “For Rent” sign is a crime. I’m sure we all remember Hardee’s Hamburgers’ impeccable taste. 

Student Agencies is making a grave mistake and is doing an injustice to the Ithaca community. I hope people will join me on Eddy Street when it’s time to do their laundry and if root beer is your pleasure, try another soft drink that doesn’t leave such a bad taste in your mouth.
