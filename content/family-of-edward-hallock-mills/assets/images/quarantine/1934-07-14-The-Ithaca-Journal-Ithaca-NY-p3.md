Pair Arrested In Break at Brooktondale 

Apprehended near Whitney Point yesterday afternoon by Corporal John Kelly and Trooper Walter J. Sweeney of the State Police in connection with a burglary at Brooktondale shortly after noon yesterday, two youths were being held for the grand jury today. 

The youths were Lee Delmage, 19, of Brooktondale, and Floyd Heath, 19, of Besemer. They are charged with third degree burglary and grand larceny in the second degree. 

Miss Emily Mills, an elderly woman, who conducts a small store at Brooktondale, reported that her place had been broken into yesterday noon while she was at lunch and $135 in cash taken. Delmage and Heath were trailed to Ithaca where it was learned that Delmage had just purchased a cheap car. 

Hearing that the youths were headed for Binghamton, Corporal Kelly telephoned ahead and then started in pursuit. The youths were apprehended near Whitney Point by Corporal Fordham and Trooper Keefe of Broome County and held for the local officers. 

The two youths were brought back to Slaterville and arraigned before Justice of the Peace Charles Thomas. They chose to waive examination. Bail will probably be set later.
