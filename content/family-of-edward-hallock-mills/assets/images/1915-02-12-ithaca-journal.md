    William Ashley "Billy" Sunday was a professional baseball player turned Presbyterian evangelist. He emphasized temperance and the cited sermon is perhaps his most famous, said to have convinced many to quit drinking. Known for being theatrical, he was one of the first preachers to make use of radio, and he was a major influence in the prohibition movement.

**MRS. HANNAH MILLS, 91, STAUNCH W.C.T.U**

**Aged Woman Entertains the Union and Joins in Songs—Meeting Report**

Brookton, Feb. 12.—There will be services as usual in both churches Sunday.

The W. C. T. U. met with Mrs. Hannah Mills Wednesday. Mrs. Mills is the oldest member of the union, being nearly ninety-one years old. She welcomed each member with a hearty handshake, joined in all the songs and took an active part in the meeting. The devotional exercises were conducted by Mrs. Daniel Mason. Mrs. Mulks read extracts from Billy Sunday's famous sermon on "Booze; Or, Get on the Water Wagon." Refreshments were served. Mrs. Simon Roe shows a decided improvement and it is hoped she will entirely regain her health.
