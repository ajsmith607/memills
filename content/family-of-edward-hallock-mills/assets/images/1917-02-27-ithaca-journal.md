  - Although impossible to say with certainty, several aspects of this notice suggest to me that it could have been written by Emily. 
  
  - The text of the poem is the first four lines of "Rest" by Mary T. Lathrap (commonly cited as Latrhop), a nationally recognized temperance leader in the late 1800's. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Torrans_Lathrap): "Mary Torrans Lathrap née, Torrans; (pen name, Lena; April 25, 1838 - January 3, 1895), known as "The Daniel Webster of Prohibition", was a 19th-century American poet, preacher, suffragist, and temperance reformer. For 20 years, she was identified with the progressive women of Michigan who had temperance, purity, and prohibition as their watchwords, and the white ribbon as their badge. A licensed preacher for the Methodist Episcopal Church (1871), she served as president of Michigan's Woman's Christian Temperance Union (1882), co-founded the state's suffrage organization (1870), and worked on the amendment campaign (1874). Lathrap died in 1895." Note the parallels to Annis Ford Eastman. This poem has been used often in obituaries since it was penned, either in part or in its entirety, and it was obviously a fitting tribute to Hannah's life.
  
  - [Reverend Elder Charles Bogardus](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/98809451/charles-bogardus) (19 Nov 1843 to 12 Oct 1925). In the 1870 census, he is a farmer in Caroline, but he later became a Baptist minister residing in Brookton. "For 20 or more years he was pastor of five churches visiting them once each month." (17 Oct 1925, The Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p5.) "He was one of the best known clergymen in this section and many couples now residing here, began their married life with his blessing. He was also called upon to officiate at many funerals. He was well-known as Elder Bogardus." (12 Oct 1925, The Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p5.)

  - Notice that in the 1870 United States Federal Census, both Hannah and then husband Charles Eastman both have checks in the columns labelled "Cannot read." and "Cannot write.", although presumably this is inaccurate, as Hannah is described as “a great reader”.

**BROOKTON**

Brookton, Feb. 27.—Mrs. Hannah Mills, widow of the late E. H. Mills, died Sunday at her home in Brookton, at the advanced age of 93 years. Mrs. Mills was one of Brookton's oldest and most respected citizens and a remarkable woman. She enjoyed very good health, and had all her faculties up to the last. She was a great reader, and kept herself posted on all the current events and liked to converse upon them. Mrs. Mills was enthusiastic in the temperance movement and a member of the W. C. T. U. and Ladies' Aid society. 

"Beautiful toiler—thy work all done; 

Beautiful soul into glory gone; 

Beautiful life with its crown now won; 

God giveth thee rest."

Funeral services Wednesday morning at 11 o'clock, Mr. Bogardus officiating. Burial at Pleasant Grove.
