Two More Bodies of the Victims of the Seawanhaka Disaster. 

The body which was found in the river, off the Atlantic Dock Basin, yesterday morning, has been identified as that of Horatio W. Mills. W. J. Mills, the brother of the deceased, who resides at No, 14 West Seventeenth street, New York, called at the Morgue last evening, and fully identified the body as that of his brother, whom he had not seen since last Saturday. Deceased was unmarried, and a lawyer by occupation. He recently lived in Twenty-second street, New York, and when his brother saw him last he told him that he was going to find a place convenient to the city. When he took his last trip on the ill fated steamer he was on his way to Smithtown, L.1., where he intended to board for a few weeks, and from which place the funeral will take place to-morrow. 

The nude body which was found at Robertsâ€™ stores was identified as that of Horace A, Schreiner by his nephew, Paul S. Tunison. The wife and family of the deceased are at present in Europe, and he had closed up his residence at No. 51 Cambridge place for the Summer. Mr. Schreiner was bookkeeper for Mumford, Thompson & Co., No. 90 Wall street, Now York. There is no doubt whatever that he was on the Seawanhaka, as the expressman brought his trunk there. The body was removed to the residence of his sister, Mrs. Timison, at No, 193 Gates avenue, from whence the funeral took place at 4 P. M,, to-day, 

Dr. Henry C. Simms, the Coroner, has not yet made arrangements for holding the inquest.
