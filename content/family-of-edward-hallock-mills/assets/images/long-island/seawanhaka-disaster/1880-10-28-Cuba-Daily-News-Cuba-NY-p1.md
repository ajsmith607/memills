The Seawanhaka Disaster.

New York, Oct. 28.â€”The indicted owners and the captain and engineer of the ill-fated steamer Seawanhaka and the steamboat inspectors, appeared yesterday before United States Judge Benedict and withdrew the plea of not guilty to the charges of manslaughter. The counsel announces it was their intention to move to quash the indictments. The courts said that it would fix a day for heating the motions.
