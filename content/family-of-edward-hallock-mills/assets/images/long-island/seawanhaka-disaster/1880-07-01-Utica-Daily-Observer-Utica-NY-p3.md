THE TOTAL NUMBER LOST IN EAST RIVER REACHES 61!

And There Are Yet More to Hear From– $1,000 Raised for the Brave Rescuers—Nine Disabled Vessels in  the Port—Still Another Collision.

[By Telegraph to the Utica Observer.]

New York, July 1.—Twenty-seven corpses have been recovered from the Seawanhaka, and twenty-five identified. Additional inquiries yesterday at the Morgue swell the list of missing to thirty-two, and two victims remaining on Ward’s Island will not survive. This places the probable total at sixty-one deaths, with possibly more to hear from,

The subscriptions for the officers of the Seawanhaka and others who displayed courage during tho recent disaster, has reached nearly $1,000 thus far. 

SUCCESSION OF DISABTERS. 

Yesterday, nine steam vessels, recently either burned or temporarily disabled by fire or collision, were lying in port.
