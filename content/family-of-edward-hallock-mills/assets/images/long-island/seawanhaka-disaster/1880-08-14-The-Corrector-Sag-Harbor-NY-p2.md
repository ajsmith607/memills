THE SEAWANHAKA DISASTER. 

The U.S. Grand Jury which has been holding an inquest upon the Seawanhaka disaster makes a long presentment which is both timely and considerate. The jury also indict the officers and owners of the Seawanhaka, and the Government inspectors, the latter for incompetence and negligence in inspection of boilers and machinery, the former for running the boat in violation of the navigation laws, with insufficient apparatus for life saving in case of disaster. The Jury then make many recommendations in regard to the revision of the Navigation Laws, and the equipment of steamers with the necessary life-saving appliances and the inspection of hulls, boilers and machinery by expert engineers. 

The recommendations of the Jury should be carried out in the form of law and enforced to the letter.
