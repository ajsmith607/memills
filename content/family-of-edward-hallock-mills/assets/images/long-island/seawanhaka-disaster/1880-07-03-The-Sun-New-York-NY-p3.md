EIGHT MORE BODIES FOUND

FIRING CANNON AND EXPLODING DYNAMITE AT THE SUNKEN MEADOWS.

Only Five Persons Now Positively Known to be Missing—Thirty-eight Identified Dead–Bold River Thieves Plundering the Wreck–More Funerals of the Victims.

At low water yesterday a detail of gunners from the Navy Yard commenced firing the two pieces of artillery which had been placed in position on Ward’s Island, just opposite the point on Sunken Meadows where the Seawanhaka was beached. Heavy charges were used and firing continued until 3 P.M. At about 6 o’clock a skilled diver put on his armor and helmet and descended into the water and placed a dynamite cartridge on a rock near the after part of the vessel. A minute later this was exploded by a battery on the diver’s launch. A sharp report followed, and then a body of water topped by a shower of spray ascended in the air, and all awaited the result with great suspense. The shock killed numerous fishes, whose bodies soon floated on the surface, but had no other immediate effect. The diver then descended and made a complete search under the port wheel and along the submerged hull to the rudder and beyond. Up to 8 1/2 o’clock, when work was discontinued, he discovered no bodies, but had brought up numerous articles of clothing. These were a brown and white checked calico or gingham cheque, with agate buttons, belonging to a girl or small-sized woman; a printed bandanna shawl, a woman’s white undergarment, a man’s black travelling cap, a set of shawl or coat straps, and a pillow case. The search will be resumed to-day, and it is probable that the company will send a force of men to tear off and remove all that part of the guards, rails, or hull [unclear] under which there is the slightest possibility of a body being found. Superintendent Kirk of the company was up with a steam tug yesterday endeavoring to remove the port wheel, but the handling bolts kept it in position, and he was compelled to wait for more effective appliances. The report of a woman’s body having been seen under the wheel may not prove true, the diver yesterday having made a fruitless search for it.

A number of the relatives of missing persons who have been at the scene of the wreck since last Tuesday morning continued their sad search yesterday, and received much sympathy. Commissioner Brennan took charge of the articles recovered and conveyed them to the Ward’s Island Morgue. It is thought that the firing and explosion of a dynamite cartridge, though not immediate in their effects, may cause bodies to rise later, which will be found according as the tide has taken them to-day. Should no more be found it will be an indication that the rest of the missing are either pinned under the wreck or actually burned up.

River thieves made their appearance again yesterday, the force of police inadequate to effectually drive them away. One of them was so bold as to actually steal an acid cup from the diver’s launch, full of men.

Capt. Smith and Mrs. Myers, Miss Diller, and Miss Wylie still remain at Randall’s Island Hospital. Capt. Smith was quite cheerful yesterday. He said he slept several hours the night previous and was in much less pain. Mrs. Myers and Miss Diller are doing well, but Miss Wylie continues quite prostrated. The body of Mr. Rauscher is still at Ward’s Island Hospital.

Louisa Schneider of Canarsie, L.I., reported yesterday at the Morgue that her sister Mary, 19 years old, took passage on the Seawanhaka last Monday afternoon, and that she has not since been heard from. The description will be found in the list of the missing.

Four bodies were brought to the New York Morgue yesterday, three of which were identified as having been victims of the disaster and the fourth is supposed to be. One was that of Hiland R. Hulburd of Great Neck. It was removed by the relatives. The body was found in Hell Gate and taken to Ward’s Island, whence it was brought to the Morgue.

Another body was that of Daniel Moore of 425 West Twenty-sixth street. It was found in the Harlem River, near the foot of 136th street. On its arrival at the Morgue, the widow was sent for by Assistant Keeper Joseph Fogarty, who recognized it from the description in the Morgue books. It yet remains at the Morgue.

The body of the colored girl, Jennie Jones, daughter of Charity Jones of 109 West Twenty-sixth street, was recognized at the Morgue by the mother, who was so prostrated by grief that she had to be carried to an inner room, where restoratives were administered. She cried again and again the it was the only child left her, and that now she had nothing to live for. Mother and child leaped off of the burning boat together, but they were separated. When the mother was rescued the child could not be found.

The fourth body was that of a tall man will full dark whiskers. Only the shirt, trousers, and shoes, (elastic gaiters) were on the body. The trousers, which were wet, were of a dark gray color with small stripes. There was a large scalp wound on the back of the head. It appeared as if the man had been attempting to strip off his clothes when he was drowned. Assistant Keeper Fogarty thought there was sufficient resemblance to the description in the books of John Wright, restaurant keeper of Glen Cove dock, to justify him in telegraphing Mrs. Johnson of that place, to whom information of the missing man was to be sent. The description of John Wright is as follows: “Fifty-three years old, six feet high, slender, dark complexion, dark hair mixed with gray, full dark whiskers mixed with gray, check suit, white shirt, Masonic pin on the vest.” There is no hair on the head of the body, but its removal is possibly accounted for by the action of the water.

Two bodies were found yesterday on the Brooklyn river front. Night watchman A.P. Peterson of Pinto’s stores found one floating in with the tide at 5:30 A.M. and recovered it. This body was last evening identified as that of Horatio W. Mills of Smithtown, L.I., by his brother, Alfred I. Mills, who knew nothing beyond the fact that his brother was on board of the ill-fated vessel.

The other body was picked up at 9 A.M., off Martin’s stores. It was that of a man of stout build, about 35 years old, five feet eight inches high with dark brown hair and side whiskers. Mr. O.H. Schreiner of 51 Cambridge place, Brooklyn, last evening identified the body as that of his brother, Horace A. Schreiner, bookkeeper for Minford, Thomson & Co., 90 Wall street.

The body of Aneta Reynes, niece of Reynes Brothers of 46 Exchange place, was found yesterday in the East River, at Flood Rock, and taken to the Coroner’s office at Long Island City.

The body of ex-Assemblyman Joseph I. Stein was found yesterday afternoon at Strong’s dock, Flushing Bay, wedged in between two rocks. The body was dressed in a blue diagonal suite. There were found in the pockets a gold watch, diamond ring, four pocketbooks, one containing [ten?] dollars, steamer tickets, professional cards, two safe keys, and a silver match box, with initials. Lawyer Van Nostrand identified the remains. Judge Lawrence held an inquest, and the body was removed to an undertaker’s. The remains will be brought to this city to-day. The funeral will take place to-morrow at 9 A.M. from the house 262 East Fifty-second street.

The Health Department was notified yesterday that a number of the Seawanhaka dead, whose bodies were found floating in the East River, had been removed to the Long Island shore in place of to the New York side of the river. It was said that some of the Long Island coroners who are still paid on the fee system, have induced persons to engage in these transactions by the promise to share the fees with them. Superintendent Wailing has ordered the Harbor and Harlem police to arrest such persons, their actions being in violation of the Health code provisions prohibiting the removal of dead bodies without a permit.

THIRTY-EIGHT DEAD, FIVE MISSING.

The list of dead recovered and identified now numbers thirty-eight. The bodies of seven of the thirteen missing person named in yesterday’s Sun were recovered and identified yesterday. They were the bodies of ex-Comptroller of the [Carrency?] Hiland R. Hurlburd of Great Neck; Daniel Moore, laborer, of 425 West Twenty-sixth street; Jennie Jones, a babe, of 109 West Twenty-sixth street; Aneta Reynes, 14 years old, niece of Reynes Brothers, 46 Exchange place; Horace Schreiner, bookkeeper for Minford, Thompson & Co., 90 Wall street; ex-Assemblyman Joseph I. Stein, 202 East Fifty-second street; John Wright, Glen Cove. The body of Horatio W. Mills, Smithtown, L.Il, who had not heretofore been reported missing, was also found.

Mrs. Ann Hall of Bayville, Long Island, who was reported missing by a neighbor, was not on board the boat and William Nichols of Sea Cliff is at home uninjured.

The changes, therefore, leave five missing persons. Their names are as follows:

Aucaigne, Mrs. Minnie, 3[0?]4 West Thirtieth street.

Banks, Frederick B., Norwalk, Conn.

Palmer, Mary, of the Sea Cliff House.

Smith, M. M. N. of Great Neck.

Schneider, Mary, aged 19, 5 feet 7 inches high, brown eyes, blue suit, elastic gaiters, blue stockings, black hat turned up to the left side, gold ring, handkerchief and underclothing marked with her name. Information should be sent to her sister, Louisa Schneider, Canarsie, Long Island. 

A DISABLED RESCUER.

John Henry Bush, for many years a waterman on the upper part of the East River, yesterday told the story of his success in saving life at the burning of the Seawanhaka. His arm was bandaged and his left hand was in a sling. His wounds cannot be healed in less than six weeks. He is poor, and has a wife and two children. He said: “I was rowing with my wife, who is in delicate health, and our two children, in a small boat near Hell Gate, when I saw the Seawanhaka coming up. A puff of smoke arose from her. Then smoke and flame burst out through her deck. I paddled to Randall’s Island as fast as I could, hurried the family out of the boat and then hoisted sail and rowed in the direction of the steamer. As I approached, people began scrambling over the sides and the stern of the steamer and dropping into the water. They were nearly all women. Their cries and screams were horrible. I picked up eight women, the first that I came to, and my boat’s gunwales were down to the water’s edge. Rowing to the shores with them, I returned empty-handed, for more. I rowed close under the stern of the Seawanhaka. Men and women stood inside and outside of the railing, afraid to jump. The clothing on some was smoking. When they saw my boat, a few tried to jump into it, while others jumped into the water near me. Those who alighted in the boat I had to shower with water, as their clothing was burning. When nine people, eight women, and a man, were in the boat I had to row to the shore again. Scarcely one had a life preserver. The drowned marsh where I set them ashore was about seventy-five feet distant.

“When I started out for the third time the steamer was covered with fire. On the stern, just over the rudder, stood a woman inside of the railing, hanging to it by the left hand, and holding out a baby. The baby screamed and kicked. The woman seemed to stagger. I jumped up on the seat, and could just reach the baby’s leg. I grabbed it and doused it in the water. The skin on its arms, stomach, and legs was burned. I don’t know whether it lives or not. The woman was Mrs. Catherine Rauscher of 436 West Fifty-third street. On the way back I picked up a 3-months-old baby, floating face downward. Putting both babies in the bottom of the boat, I rowed ashore, not heeding those with life preservers on in the water. On my fourth and last trip, I picked up two women, each about 30 years old and wearing silk and jewelry. They died before reaching shore.”

Bush rescued from drowning a man named Amos in Flushing Bay in 1879, and excursionist in 1876, and a man in 1874 off 125th street. He says that he is destitute and burdened with family cares.

Among the passengers on the Seawanhaka was Mr. H.V. Duryea, father of Wright Duryea, President of the Glen Cove Starch Manufacturing Company. Mr. Duryea is over 80 years old, and has had one hand amputated. While the excitement was at its height, he became separated from his son, George Duryea, and another gentleman, who were with him, and stood helplessly among the passengers at the stern of the boat. One of the lady passengers, noticing that he had no life-preserver, asking him why he did not secure one. He replied by showing her his disabled arm. Instantly, she volunteered to aid him, and carefully tied a life preserver about his body. When he got into the water he found that his life-preserver was too low down, and tended to cause his head to go under water. Others where were floating near kindly helped him until the boats arrived. Mr. Duryea advertises to-day for the name of his fair benefactor. Mr. George Duryea jumped off the bow, and found his father on Randall’s Island.

BURIAL OF THE VICTIMS.

In accordance with a wish expressed some time ago by the Rev. Dr. J.W. Diller, one of the victims of the Seawanhaka disaster, when he thought he was about to die, a communion service was held yesterday morning in St. Luke’s Episcopal Church, and about 500 persons who had been his parishioners partook of the communions, which was administered by the Rev. George R. Van De Water, rector of the church, the Rev. Dr. Samuel Haskins, Dr. D.V.M. Johnson, and the Rev. Mr. Penson. As Dr. Diller also had requested that the poor of the parish should be remembered at the communion service, a collection was taken up in their behalf. The funeral services were held in the church in the afternoon, when the edifice was crowded, and a large number of persons stood outside. A large number of the clergy of the diocese, in their roles of office, moved in the procession from the vestry to the gate of the church, where they met the relatives of the dead preacher. As they marched into the church, where the surpliced boy choirs from St. Mary’s and St. Luke’s Episcopal Churches sang “Abide with Me.” The body was enclosed in a cloth-covered coffin, which rested on pedestals in front of the altar. After the ritual services, Bishop Littlejohn spoke briefly of the long labors and signal virtues of the dead pastor, and the Rev. Dr. Drowne of Garden City gave a sketch of Dr. Diller’s life. Dr. Drowne concluded by reading a series of resolutions which had been adopted by the clergy of the diocese. The interment was in Mount Olivet Cemetery at Maspeth, Queens County, L.I. Among the mourners at the funeral were the Sisters of St. Luke’s Hospital at Albany avenue and Herkimer street. The memorial sermon in connection with Dr. Diller’s death is to be preached on Sunday next by the Rev. Mr. Vandewater.

In a vine-covered cottage at 1,350 Pacific street, Brooklyn, the funeral of Mrs. George W. Colton took place yesterday afternoon. Mrs. Colton was drowned while attempting to escape from the burning Seawanhaka. Her body was almost immediately recovered, and, as it lay yesterday in the back parlor of the cottage, no trace of any external injury was perceptible. The body was encased in a black cloth-covered coffin bearing a simple inscription. Although the friends of Mrs. Colton were requested not to bring flowers, many did so, and the coffin was decorated with many very beautiful floral emblems. Dr. Cuthbert Hall read the service. Late in the afternoon the body was taken to Greenwood. 

John McGivern, another of the victims, was buried yesterday afternoon, from his late residence at 441 West Twenty-sixth street. McGivern and Thomas Flannigan of 423 West Twenty-sixth street, both laborers, went aboard the unfortunate Seawanhaka in company. Both were drowned.

The funeral of Mary A. Flynn, a maiden lady who was drowned after the Seawanhaka disaster, took place yesterday at 2,249 Second avenue where she resided with her brother, Mr. John Flynn. The attendance was very large and the floral offerings numerous and beautiful. The casket was of chestnut, covered with black cloth, and the plate gave the name and date of death, June 28. Father Trainor, pastor of St. Lawrence Catholic Church in Eighty-fourth street, read the service. He spoke of the deceased as not only having faith, but as being diligent in good works and a very active member of the ladies’ Sodality of his church. The poor, he said, would miss her greatly.

THE INQUEST.

Coroner James Davron of Long Island City took the testimony on Monday night at Astoria of Wallace C. Pendleton, cook on the schooner Sardinian of Rockland, Ma., who said that as the schooner was being towed through Hell Gate to New York, at about 5 o’clock, the Seawanhaka approached in a burning condition, and was about abreast of the inebriate asylum on Ward’s Island and about the middle of the channel, when he saw a man jump overboard. The Schooner’s boat was lowered, and he was saved. It then went after another man, and rescued him. About 300 yards from where the first man was picked up the witness saw a woman, who had been lying sick in the cottage on the Government works at Hallett’s Point, and picked her up. Then picked up another woman. Seeing no one else, the boat made for land, The last woman picked up seemed to be dead. The other woman never spoke after being taken from the water. The first woman subsequently proved to be Miss Mary A. Flynn. The other was afterward resuscitated.

On Tuesday evening, at Long Island City, Coroner Davron took testimony concerning the body of Miss Mary Ann Flynn. P.S. Trainor of 325 East 116th street recognized the body as that of Miss Flynn, who resided at 2,249 Second Avenue. She left home to go and see her uncle at Whitestone. She was about 36 years of age, and was born in New York city.

On Wednesday Coroner Davron took the testimony of Benjamin C. Kirk of Glen Cove, who said that he had been steadily employed for the past two years as superintendent of the Seawanhaka, and had been also so employed irregularly for six years. As he was collecting fares with the clerk he looked into the engine room to see if any passengers were sitting there. There was no sign of fire at this time, but in not more than one minute after he heard an alarm of fire. Went immediately forward again, and saw that the fire was all around the engine room, and under such headway that it would be impossible to extinguish it; closed the gangway doors to prevent a draught, and went to the pilot house, where he told the Captain to run the boat ashore, as she was on fire, and that the flames could not be quenched. The Captain at once headed her for the Sunken Meadows. Witness then went on the promenade deck to assist the ladies and passengers generally to the forward deck as a place of safety until the boat reached the shore. After the passengers were all off the promenade deck it grew so hot that witness could no longer stay there, and, as the boat was ashore, he jumped overboard and aided fifteen or twenty ladies and gentlemen who were in the water. With the assistance of the mate and the clerk, all were rescued who were near the spot. Witness then took a boat, and, as he went ashore, rescued four ladies aft of the wheel, on the same side of the boat, who were hanging on to the guard braces.

James W. Ray of Roslyn, L.I., said that he had been mate of the Seawanhaka for fourteen years, and a dock hand previously for five years. The steamer in that period had sustained but one accident. That was eight or nine years ago, when a cylinder broke. No person was hurt. Mr. Ray then repeated substantially the same account of the recent disaster as had been published as coming from him. 

Other witnesses were examined, without eliciting anything new.
