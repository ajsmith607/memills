THE DEPTHS.

Two Drowned Bodies Found in the River.

One of Them, and Probably Both, Victims of the Seawanhaka Disaster—Clues to their Identification.

The body of a drowned man, who was undoubtedly a victim of the Seawanhaka disaster, was picked up in the river this morning and is now at the Raymond street Morgue, awaiting identification. About half-past five o’clock, A. P. Paterson, night watchman at F. G. Pinto’s stores, Atlantic Dock basin, saw the body floating in with the tide, and procuring a shell boat rowed out and secured it. Dr. Henry C. Simms, the Coroner, subsequently ordered its removal to the Morgue, where it will remain until claimed by relatives or friends. The body is that of a man about 35 years of age; 5 feet 9 inches in height, of stout build, mustache, sandy hair and bald on the top of the head, and was dressed in a gray tweed suit, plaid shirt, white cotton undershirt and congress gaiters. On the small of the back was a severe bruise, as if he had been struck by some heavy substance. If a passenger on the ill fated Seawanhaka, he was probably struck by the wheel. When the body was removed to the Morgue a careful examination of the body and articles on it was made and the following were found: $14 in money, a small silver watch, which ad stopped at four minutes’ past 5 o’clock, just the time when the disaster referred to occurred, a small memorandum book, two business cards of C. J. Thomas, diamond broker, No. 661 Broadway, New York, on the back of one of which was the following memorandum: “30 days, May 29, 1880, Mr. James, gold chain, $10.” There was also a piece of paper on which was written in a bold male hand the following: “Mrs. H. W. Thorpe, Scudin House, Glenwood, L.I., steamer Seawanhaka; Peck Slip 4:15 daily. Steam cars from Hunter’s Point to Glen Head, any hour up to 6:30 P.M.” It would seem from this memorandum that the unfortunate passenger, whoever he was, was going to Glenwood to visit Mrs. Thorpe, and had received directions as to the two routes which he could take to reach Glenwood. There was also a business card of “Martin Klenan, real estate, mortgage and insurance broker, office No. 55 Liberty street, corner of Nassau, and 46 East Twenty-third street, New York, M. C. A. B.” The two memorandum books do not give any clue to identification, with the single exception, that on the fly leaf of one of them is the entry, “Horatio B. Mills, brother of W. J. Mills, 14 West Seventeenth street.” The books are filled with the numbers of houses in New York, the names of the residents no however being given. Appended to some of the numbers is the suggestive word “good.” Superintendent Campbell has communicated all the facts bearing on the case to the New York police authorities, with a view to secure the identification of the body. There is no name among those reported missing which corresponds with any found in these papers and memoranda. The body, however, will probably be identified before evening.

ANOTHER DROWNED BODY

was found this morning in the river outside Roberts’ stores, and was also taken to the Morgue. It i s that of a man about 35 years of age, five feet nine inches in height, with dark hair and side whiskers and mustache. The only clothing on the body was a white cotton outside and a light flannel inside shirt. The right leg was cut off below the knee. This is likewise supposed to be the body of one of the victims of the disaster. The theory is that he was a passenger who went to this state room and undressed as soon as he got on the boat, and that his leg was cut off by the wheel. The body looks as if it had been in the water only three or four days.

The first body is supposed to be that of Horatio W. Mills, of Smithtown, Suffolk County, New York. Post Office address, New York City, 5,911.

In the shirt on the second box there were three pearl studs in shirt front, a pair of sleeve buttons, with letter “S.,” and on the shirt band were the letters “H. A. B.,” which correspond with the initials of one of the missing passengers, named Horace A. Schriener. The blue scarf was held together with a plated wire ring. Superintendent Campbell has communicated with the New York police authorities in reference to this body also.
