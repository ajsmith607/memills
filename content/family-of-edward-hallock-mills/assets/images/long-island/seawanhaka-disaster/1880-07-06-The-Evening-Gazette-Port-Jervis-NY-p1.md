A VICTIM OF THE SEAWANHAKA. 

IDENTIFYING THE BODY OF HORATIO W. MILLS, COUSIN OF THE REV. DR. MILLS, 

The missing passengers upon the unfortunate Seawanhaka have nearly if not all been now recovered. Among those found on Friday last was Horatio W. Mills, a cousin of the Rev. S. W. Mills of this village. But for the following entry upon a card in one of his pockets his body might have remained unidentified and been consigned to the Potter’s Field: "Horatio W. Mills, brother of W. J. Mills of No. 14 West 17th street, New York.” 

The brother knew nothing of his being upon the vessel until apprised of the writing upon the card, when he recognized the body, which was sadly bruised by a blow upon the back, probably from the steamer’s paddle-wheel. 

The deceased was about 40 years of age and was the son of William Wickham Mills of Smithtown, L. 1, who was regarded in his day as the wealthiest man in Suffolk county.
