THE ACTION OF THE "SEAWANHAKA's" OWNERS CREATES SURPRISE.

Thirty-Eight Victims Identified So Far–More Being Found Every Day–The Wreck to Be Blown Up, When Still Others Will Come to the Surface.

[By Telegraph to the Utica Observer.]

NEW YORK, July 3.–The bodies of 38 victims of the Seawanhaka disaster have been identified. Only five are now positively known to be missing.

TO BE BLOWN UP.

The work of recover is progressing rapidly. It is stated the company is going to blow up the wreck. This will bring all the bodies to the surface.

COMPETING CORONERS.

Complaints reached the Board of Health today that boatmen were towing bodies from the wreck to the Long Island Shore in order to benefit Queen’s County coroners. The police have been ordered to arrest those found removing bodies from the New York side.

BODIES FOUND YESTERDAY.

The body of a man was picked up at Brooklyn, yesterday. The deceased was about thirty-five years of age and had on a gray tweed suit. In his pocket was found the address of “Mrs. H. W. Thorpe, Scudder House Glenwood, L.I.” A silver watch and $14 in money were also found. The bodies of H. R. Huredurd, Daniel Moore and Jennie Jones, colored, were brought to the morgue from the scene of the disaster, yesterday afternoon. The body found floating at the Atlantic dock, Brooklyn, early yesterday morning, was identified as that of Horatio W. Mills, of Smithtown, L.I., a victim of the Seawanhaka disaster. A second body, which floated in at Martin’s stores, Brooklyn, was identified as that of another victim, Horace H. Schreimer, of Brooklyn.

EX-ASSEMBLYMAN STEIN.

FLUSHING, L.I. July 3.–A body found last evening has been identifies as ex-Assemblyman Joseph J. Stein, of New York. At the Coroner’s inquest the remains were fully identified as those of ex-Assemblyman Stein, and a verdict was rendered that deceased came to his death by drowning.

ESCAPED SAFELY.

COLLEGE POINT, L.I., July 3.–William Nichols, of Sea Cliff, Mrs. D. Meissner, Mrs. Thorp, and Miss Annie Simonson, all of Glenwood, among the missing passengers of the Seawanhaka, were found uninjured, except Mrs. Meissner, who sustained internal injuries.

WHO SAVED H. W. DURYEA!

NEW YORK, July 3.–The address of the lady on the Seawanhaka who secured a life preserver on the person of H. W. Duryea, and assisted him to escape the terrible death, is advertised for. Duryea is 82 years of age and one-armed. He is the senior member of a starch manufacturing firm at Glen Cove. While he was standing on the hurricane deck with a life preserver in his hand, a young lady asked him, “Why do you not adjust it?” “I cannot,” was the reply, “I am one-armed.” She adjusted the preserver and Duryea, jumping from the burning steamer, was picked up by a boat from the Granite State.

NON-ACTION OF THE OWNERS.

NEW YORK, July 3.–The conduct of the owners of the Seawanhaka is wondered at by those who have been engaged in the search for the bodies at the wreck. All that has been done toward recovering the remains of the victims of the terrible disaster has been accomplished through the Commissioners of Charities and Corrections, by divers employed by private individuals or by boatman stimulated by the offer of large rewards for securing certain bodies.
