DEATH ON THE DEEP. 

THE STREAMER SEAWANHAKA BURNED AND BEACHED. 

DETAILS OF THE HORROR—FIRE CAUSED BY AN EXPLOSION—FORTY PERSONS DROWNED PROMINENT PASSENGERS—AN AWFUL CATASTROPHE.  

College Point, L. I., June 28.—The steamboat Seawanhaka, which ran from Peck’s slip up the sound, to Glen Coye, L. L, took fire at 4:30 Tuesday while off Randall’s Island, East river. The fire was caused by an explosion in the engine room and the middle part of the steamboat was soon in flames. 

The pilot, Charles Smith, was nearly burned to death, and succeeded in beaching the vessel on a sunken meadow adjoining the Island. 

Many persons sprang overboard and were drowned. Many others in the stern of the vessel could not get off, and were burned to death. Of 300 supposed to have been on board, 50 are believed to have perished. The bodies of about 30 have been recovered. Only those of Dr. Bebaise, a wealthy gentleman, residence unknown, and Mary Reed, a young woman, were identified. 

Among the persons of prominence known to have been on board were Charles A. Dana, editor of the Sun, S. L. M. Barlow, Col. W. R Chase and R. H. Rochester, treasurer of the Western Union Telegraph Company. 

CAPT. SMITH’S STATEMENT. 

Capt. Charles P. Smith, who commanded the Seawanhaka, lay in a private room in the hospital on Randall’s Island. The Captain is a large and stout man, and naturally of a florid color. But his face last evening, as a result of the burning that it received, was swollen to nearly double its ordinary size, and reddened to angry hue. Oil-soaked bandages covered the greater part of his face, the upper part of his body, and his arms and hands. The Captain appeared not to heed the great pain he must have suffered, and spoke cheerily. 

“I can remember,” he said, “only that we were opposite the entrance to Little Hell Gate at about 4:50, when I heard a dull, heavy explosion, and felt a strong, jar under me. I was in the pilot house, at the wheel, with an assistant. Almost as soon as I felt the jar fire burst through the hurricane deck, and spread like a train of gunpowder backward, and forward. The passengers began to run wildly to and fro on the lower decks, and I shouted to them to be quiet, and all would yet be well. But the flames spread, and the passengers became more excited. We were at the point of the Sunken Meadows, nearly opposite Randall’s Island. 

I felt that the only place where I could possibly beach the Seawanhaka with surety was the meadows. I turned her head straight as a die for the meadows. I held on to the wheel, and kept calling to the passengers below to get forward, if possible, and stick to the boat. But, though I was directing my whole attention to the meadows, looking out for the longest and marshiest spot, I could see that some of the passengers in their fright, took to the water. The Seawanhaka obeyed her helm to a charm; and swept onward toward the meadows. I picked out the spot where I saw the beach lying lowest, and bore down upon it. The Seawanhaka grated upon the thick undergrowth, and almost leaped upon the beach. She rose out of the water until her paddle-wheels were high and dry. Then the passengers on the bow leaped down into the yielding marsh, and clambered up to dry land. Those at the stern jumped overboard and swam to the beach or were picked up by the small boats that came from the New York shore or Randall’s Island. I do not recollect clearly how I got ashore, but I soon found myself in the kindly hands of the doctors from Randall’s Island. 

FIREMAN ABEEL’S STORY, 

Edward Abeel, one of the firemen on the Seawanhaka, made the following statement: “The Seawanhaka left Pier 24, N. R., at 4 1/2, her usual hour of sailing. She stopped at 33d street, East River, to take aboard some more passengers, As near as I can guess there must have been somewhere in the neighborhood of 300 passengers on board. I had been working hard all day on deck, and went below to change my clothes, I took a petticoat or little hand lamp with me into the fire room, and placed it on the keelson. After fixing up I went to the amidship gangway and took a seat on the rail to look out and cool myself off. All of a sudden I heard a noise resembling somewhat on explosion, and, looking around saw flames coming up from between the fire room and engine room. In less than 10 minutes the steamer was one mass of flames from stem to stern. I jumped at once, and called the steward, and cried out to the passengers near me to procure life preservers, that the steamer was on fire. The engineer, Edgar Weeks, was talking to another fireman, and he immediately rushed for the upper deck and began raising the valves, so that no explosion could take place. The steamer went on, and cries were heard on all sides: “For God’s sake, beach her!” The Captain was doing all in his power to do so, and ran her the length of the island as fast as possible. The scene was terrible. The boat was now one fiery furnace, and passengers began to drop off and jump off into the water. There was a strong ebb tide running by this time. The Captain ran her into Little Hell Gate, between Ward’s and Randall's Islands, and beached her well up on Ward's Island. The stern of the boat was in the steam, and the rest of the passengers jumped overboard, some on the starboard and some on the port side. Some swam to Randall's Island; some to Ward's. Many boats had by this time arrived on the scene, and were picking up passengers in all directions. The Granite State was just ahead of us, but afraid to come alongside for fear she would catch fire herself. She, however, lowered boats at once. The Minnahannock and Osseo also came up and tendered much assistance in taking off and picking up passengers, as did two city boats and several rowboats. Many of the passenger I saw with life preservers. I had one myself, but gave it up to a man who could not swim. As to the loss of life, I think it was principally from drowning in the rapid current. I saw several badly burned, one man with both legs almost burned off. I also saw other almost equally heartrending instances. Of the officers and crew I believe all are saved except Josiah Hasbrouck, the cook, and Charles Hasbrouck, a waiter. Ben Kirk, the Superintendent, myself, and a few others were burned a little. When I left Ward’s Island in the evening the Seawanhaka had burned down to the water’s edge. Her smokestack and engines are still standing. I can in no way account for the fire except by guess work. The engineer and fireman were always very particular to see that no inflammable stuff lay about. Engines and boilers were considered in excellent condition. The only way I can account for it is the possibility that a flue blew out, opening the furnace door and scattering the fire a considerable distance around. The slight noise I heard may have been a flue bursting. I am certain the boiler did not burst. I think two-thirds of the passengers must have jumped over before she beached. The whole thing was almost instantaneous, affording no possibility of ascertaining with certainty the cause of the fire or even of doing anything to check it. 

THE LOST. 

There are twenty-four persons drowned and burned whose bodies were recovered [du?] to mid-night Monday and it is thought that about thirty more are yet to be accounted for.
