HUMAN GHOULS. 

They Hunt the Wreck of the Seawanhaka to Rob the Bodies of the Victims. 

[Special to the Telegram] 

New York, July 3.— There can nosy be no doubt that over sixty persons perished in the Seawanhaka disaster. The roll of the known dead already published exceeds half of that number, and it is unreasonable to suppose that the thirty-five persons who are missing would continue to absent themselves from their grief-stricken families were they living. The search for the dead continues with unabated vigor. At low water in the morning boatmen engaged at the wreck, while probing the bottom of the river with their oars, drew up a piece of brown calico, which was found ta be a portion of a woman's dress. It was disclosed, by further search, that three bodies, supposed to be women, lie imbedded in the mud under the stern of the Seawanhaka. 

THE FRIENDS OF THE DEAD 

and the residents of Harlem denounce in the strongest language the conduct of the scoundrels who have peen prowling around the ill-fated vessels night and day, and the authorities who have permitted them to reap gain by robbing the dead receive a full share of condemnation. The hardihood of the thieves will be understood from a single case. While Isaac Stern was searching on Wednesday for his fiend, ex-Assemblyman Stein, he brought to the surface the body of Mrs. Lizzie Aikens, and two forbidding looking fellows rowed over and attempted to capture it, and would have succeeded had it not been for the interference of Captain Paddy Grace of the little steamer Refuge. When the body was brought safely ashore and placed in the hands of responsible parties, Stern addressed.the thieves and offered to give them $100 if they would assist him to find Mr. Stein’s body. He states that their reply was: “To h— with the bodies; we're looking for jewelry and money.” 

SEVERAL OF THESE THIEVES, 

known in Harlem as the “Rattle Row Gang,” have recently appeared on the streets dressed in new outfits, and one of them yesterday sold, a gold watch in Harlem for $16. Yesterday three officers of the Harbor Police appeared at the wreck, and the thieves beat a hasty retreat, but, no doubt, they will return later. They are armed to the teeth, and it is about time that decent people should understand whether or not the people are able to suppress them. Commissioner Brennen brought two heavy cannon from Blackwell's Island yesterday, and had them placed in position on the low ground on Ward's Island, opposite the wreck. He gave orders that they be fired off at regular intervals during the night, in the hope of bringing the dead to the surface of the water; and while this is being done a number of row-boats will patrol the river. As the keel now lies it is impossible to bring them to the surface. One body also lies under the port paddle-wheel. These bodies can not be recovered till the wreck is removed or broken up. The work goes slowly on, and it may be a week before all the bodies are brought to the surface.
