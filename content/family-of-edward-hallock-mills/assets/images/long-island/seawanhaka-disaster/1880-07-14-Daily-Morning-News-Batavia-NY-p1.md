Swimming Versus Dancing. 

(N. Y. Mail) 

The recent disasters on neighboring waters by which large numbers of persons were lost and the frequent drowning accidents at the seaside among bathers who have not been taught the art of keeping themselves afloat, illustrate forcibly the necessity of learning to swim. The fearful mortality attending the Narragansett an Seawanhaka accidents was mainly due to the ignorance among the majority of those throwing themselves in the water of the easily acquired art of swimming, while those who were saved even when girdled with a life-preserver owe their deliverance from a watery grave to the kindly assistance of swimmers. 

Boys and girls should be taught to swim long before they are allowed to devote themselves to mathematics, ceramics, philosophy or dancing, which last is considered an indispensable concomitant to the education of a fashionable child. It is safe to state that among a hundred young men capable of leading the German with skill and grace there are not half a dozen who could save their own lives if suddenly plunged into deep water. 

The proportion of young women more skilled in the saltatory than the natatory art is still greater. If any of these capital dancers were called upon to save the lives of drowning persons they would all probably be powerless, and would themselves perish in their efforts. The swimmers of the Stonington and Seawanhaka found that their skill as such was worth much more to themselves and to society than the first attainments of the most fashionable dancing academy. 

Parents and guardians should have their youngest charges taught the art of swimmingâ€”should insist upon it. There are several first class swimming academys in New York, and they will have a feeling of safety when their charges are on or near the water to recompense them for their foresight.
