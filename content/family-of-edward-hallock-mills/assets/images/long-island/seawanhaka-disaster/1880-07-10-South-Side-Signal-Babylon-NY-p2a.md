A VICTIM OF THE SEAWANHAKA DISASTER. 

Horatio W. Mills, of Smithtown. 

The funeral services over the remains of the late Horatio W. Mills, one Of the victims of the Seawanhaka disaster, took place Sunday, July 4, at St. James Episcopal Church, Smithtown. He was the son of the late Wm. Wickham Mills, of the former place. This sad event occurred during the absence of his family, who were not aware of his being on the boat until they were notified, Friday afternoon, that his body had been found early that morning floating off Brooklyn. He was a very fine swimmer, and would doubtless have saved himself if he had not been so badly injured by the wheel. 

Mr. Mills was educated as a lawyer being a graduate of Columbia College Law School, and was endowed with talents of the highest order. He was a man of the strictest integrity, possessing one of the noblest and most generous of spirits, He did not follow his profession, but spent most of his time in traveling. His sad end has cast a deep gloom over his many friends and relatives, who mourn bis untimely fate. 

CHAUNCEY HAWKINS. 

WHEN we stated in our report of the disaster to the Seawanhaka, that Chauncey Hawkins was among the lost, we marked the similarity of names but cherished the doubt of its being our quiet but pleasant friend of that noted resort for Long Island Ship Masters, 107 South street. It proved to be a fact however, and a sad one too. Mr. Hawkins was favorably known to a host of Long Island people, and was in fact one of them. For some 14 or more years he has been connected, with the store of Mr. Mills, and during a large part of that time be occupied a very responsible position, being in charge of all orders for ship stores. He Was always obliging and ever faithful to his employers interests. He will be greatly missed not only by his employers, but by those who frequent the place. Not to find Chauncey Hawkins at his post was an exception. He will be greatly missed by all.
