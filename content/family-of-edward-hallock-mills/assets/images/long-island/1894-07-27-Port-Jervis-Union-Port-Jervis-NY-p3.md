  - "M. V. H. S." stands for the Minisink Valley Historical society, and according to Reverend Mills' obituary, he served as its president since its organization in 1889. The Society still exists as I write this. From their [website](https://www.minisink.org) "The Minisink Valley Historical Society is located at 125-133 West Main Street in Port Jervis, New York. The Fort Decker Museum of History, a stone house built in 1760, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places is the Society's museum. The Robert Kleinstuber House, which is located behind it, is the center of the Society's day-to-day activities and is the location of the Society's storage facilities."

The Reverend’s obituary in the Tri-States Union was not only the lead story of their 04 Dec 1902 edition, it took fully half of the front page and includes his photo, and reproduces many details from this history of the Mills family.

THE MILLS GENEALOGY 

COMPILED BY THE REV. S. W. MILLS OF PORT JERVIS. 

An Important Genealogical Document Embodying Much New and Valuable Information—History of the Mills Family in America.

We publish herewith a portion of the genealogy of the Mills’ family, which was compiled by Rev. Dr. S. W. Mills, of this village and read at the meeting of the M. V. H. S., at Glenette, Saturday, June 21. It embodies much information in regard to that family not hitherto made public. The remainder of the article will appear in tomorrow’s UNION. 

The name of Mills, which is found in so many parts of our country, appears to be chiefly of English origin. There are those who bear the name who are of Holland extraction. In the early settlement of New England there was one Peter Water Van der Mulin, who emigrated from Holland and settled at Windsor, Conn., and took the English name of Mills. (The English of Van der Mulin is from the Mills). This same name is found among the earlier settlers of Hartford, Conn. Of his descendants we know nothing, but it is quite probable there are those living who can trace their ancestry back to him.  

Of those of English extraction we know more. The name of Milnes or Mills, otherwise De Molis, was found in Devon, England, in 1083 6. It was derived from Meulles, Normandy. It is supposed to have been brought there in the time of William the Conquerer, who introduced the Norman language into England about 1066. Lord Haughton (Milne) has been a member of Gladstone’s Cabinet in this year, 1894. Under the various forms of Mill, Mills, Milne, Milles and Mylles, the naine is found in Yorkshire in 1530, 1560, 1584, 1612, 1627 and 1665. In Sussex county. England, it appears as follows: Geffry 'Atte Milne 1307-27; Agnes 'Atte Milne’, John ’Atte Mull’ alias Mill, Lord of Gretham 1366 ; Robert ‘Atte Mulle’ alias Mills of Gilford, Surry county, 1377-1399 ; John ’Atte Mille’ of Pullborough, 1366 ; Robert Mill of Sussex 1422-1461; John Mylle 1578 ; Sir Richard Mill (b) 1690. 

The first emigrant by the name of Mills from England of whom we have knowledge was John Mills, who came over in the fleet with Gov. Winthrop in 1629 or 1630. His name stood No. 33 on the roll of the first church in Boston, where two of his daughters (Joy and Remembrance) were baptised in October, 1630. He was made freeman in Boston, March 6, 1632. He resided there ten years and then removed to Braintree, Mass., where in 1653 he was clerk of Braintree. In his will made June 1670, he expresses the wish that his son John, to whom he gave his estate, "would bring up one of his sons to the ministry, as this had been the calling of his predecessors to the third if not the fourth generation." 

There was one Richard Mills who was called the "Pioneer Schoolmaster" of New York, who lived on Long Island and in Connecticut ; Samuel Mills, who lived at Dedham, Mass., and Samuel Mills, who lived at Windsor, Conn., all of whom came from England at a very early date, but the precise year not known. How they were related and who were their descendants we have not learned.  

George Mills was probably the ancestor of the Long Island Mills. He came from Yorkshire, England, and was born about 1605, and died at Jamaica, L. I., Oct. 17, 1694, aged 89 years, His name is found on the town records of Hempstead and Jamaica in Feb. 16, 1656, and Nov. 25, 1656, when he was granted a home lot in each town. Some have supposed that this George was a brother of John, who came over with Gov. Winthrop, but no proof of the fact has yet been found. 

Samuel, a son of George, was born in this country in 1631, and died at Jamaica in March, 1726, aged 95. A notice of his death appeared in the N. Y. Gazette of March 12, 1726, in which it was stated that he was able to do a good day’s work but a few days before he died. He had 16 children, nine of whom were living at the time of his death, 80 grandchildren and 54 great grandchildren. 

Jonathan Mills, who lived at Jamaica, and whose wife was Martha, was probably the son of George. The date of his birth and death are not known. On March 30. 1677, he bought of Jonas Halstead and his son Joseph, a piece of land owned by them jointly. His wife, Martha, was living in 1710, as well as himself. They had four children, Timothy, Samuel, Isaac and Jonathan, jr. Of these, Timothy was born in 1667, and moved from Jamaica to Mills' Pond, four mils from Smithtown, in 1693, the first of the name to locate there, and where he died March 30, 1751. By his first wife, Elizabeth, he had two children, and by his second, Sarah, eleven. Of these eleven the sixth was Jonathon, who was born Oct. 23, 1710, who was the father of Jacob Mills, Windsor, born Dec 22, 1746, and who subsequently settled in the town of New Windsor, Orange county, N. Y. 

Jonathan Mills married April 3, 1737, Ruth. Rudyard, daughter of John Rudyard of Perth Amboy, N. J., by whom he had six children. On January 25, 1756, he married Dorothy Miller, by whom he had three children. He lived at Mills Pond, where he died Oct, 23, 1798, Of the six children by his first wife, Jacob and Timothy were twins. 

The first person by the name of Mills (of the Long Island Mills) who settled in Orange county of whom we have any account, was Timothy, son of Timothy the first settler at Mills Pond, by his second wife, Sarah. He married Margaret Rudyard, daughter of John Rudyard of Perth Amboy, N. J. About 1752 a division of his father’s land on Long Island was made, and he appears to have left Mills Pond and to have settled at New Windsor, which was then in Ulster county. His deed, recorded in Ulster county Deeds (F. F. 465), dated May 20, 1754, states that he is of the precinct of Wallkill, in the county of Ulster. He bought for £370 a tract of 571 acres of land from the Garret Schuyler and Hans Ulrick Bindor heirs, who lived in New York. His will was recorded in New York in 1780, in which he mentions his sons, John, Jonathan and Daniel, and his daughters, Joannah and Anah, and also his wife, Margaret. No trace hag been found of the descendants of this Timothy Mills.
