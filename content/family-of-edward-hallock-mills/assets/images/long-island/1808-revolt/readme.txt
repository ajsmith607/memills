Luther Gleason was born December 5th, 1761, in Suffield, Hartford County, Connecticut. In November of 1776 Luther, one month shy of his 15th birthday, was serving in the Revolutionary War alongside his father, Ephraim Gleason. He then served again, this time with the 5th Connecticut Regiment, from July 1, to December 8, 1780. He served at Camp Ramapo, Morristown, New Jersey, in the Connecticut Huts of Jockey Hollow.

Luther married Mary Knap(p) in Litchfield, Connecticut in January of 1781. He went on to become a preacher, receiving his ordination in 1789/90. Luther first served the church at Stillwater, New York. In 1798 Luther was to become pastor of two churches in Long Island, a Presbyterian church in Smithtown, and a church in Babylon.

The church at Babylon had been destroyed in 1778 by the British, who used the lumber to make barracks for themselves. As a result, the town was without a church for 20 years. Luther Gleason was their first pastor, and according to an article in the May 30, 1897 edition of The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, "The Churches Of Babylon", "The Reverend Mr. Gleason had been a chaplain in the Continental army, which made him very popular with the members of his congregation".

In 1806 Luther left Long Island and returned to Connecticut, where he continued as a Pastor until 1809. at this time the family relocated to Plymouth, Chenango County, New York. Where Luther remained as a farmer until his death, at age 58, in 1819.
