  - According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primogeniture) “Primogeniture (/ˌpraɪm-ə-/ also /-oʊ-ˈdʒɛnɪtʃər/) is the right, by law or custom, of the firstborn legitimate child to inherit the parent's entire or main estate in preference to shared inheritance among all or some children, any illegitimate child or any collateral relative. In most contexts it means the inheritance of the firstborn son (agnatic primogeniture); it can also mean by the firstborn daughter (matrilineal primogeniture).”

  - According to [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/whip_the_cat#English), “whipping the cat” is defined as “(US, dialect, dated, idiomatic) To go from house to house working by the day, as itinerant tailors and carpenters do.” 

  - According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currier) “a currier is a specialist in the leather processing industry. After the tanning process, the currier applies techniques of dressing, finishing and colouring to a tanned hide to make it strong, flexible and waterproof. The leather is stretched and burnished to produce a uniform thickness and suppleness, and dyeing and other chemical finishes give the leather its desired colour. After currying, the leather is then ready to pass to the fashioning trades such as saddlery, bridlery, shoemaking and glovemaking.”

  - According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halfpenny_(British_pre-decimal_coin)) "The British pre-decimal halfpenny (1/2 d) coin, usually simply known as a ha'penny (pronounced /ˈheɪpəni/), historically occasionally also as the obol and once abbreviated ‘ob’ (from the Latin ‘obulus’), was a unit of currency that equalled half of a penny or 1/480 of a pound sterling. Originally the halfpenny was minted in copper, but after 1860 it was minted in bronze. In the run-up to decimalisation it ceased to be legal tender from 31 July 1969. … "Halfpenny" was colloquially written ha’penny, and "1+ 1/2 d" was spoken as "a penny ha’penny" /ə ˈpɛni ˈheɪpni/ or three ha’pence /θriː ˈheɪpəns/. Before Decimal Day in 1971 there were 240 pence in one pound sterling. Twelve pence made a shilling, and twenty shillings made a pound. Values less than a pound were usually written in terms of shillings and pence, e.g. 42 pence would be three shillings and sixpence (3/6), pronounced "three and six", whereas 3 shillings even would be "3s" or, on a sign in a shop, "3/-" (the dash usually being written instead of 0 for pence). Values of less than a shilling were simply written in pence, e.g. eightpence would be 8d (the "d" standing for the Latin word denarii (sing. denarius, a common coin in Roman Britain). The Halfpenny has become famous for being the only word in the English language that has a silent 'f'."

THE MILLS GENEALOGY 

COMPILED BY THE REV. S. W. MILLS OF PORT JERVIS. 

An Important Genealogical Document Embodying Much New and Valuable Information—History of the Mills Family in America.

Concluded from yesterday.

Jacob Mills, who subsequently settled in New Windsor, was a nephew of the Timothy just mentioned. His father was Jonathan Mills of Mills’s Pond by Ruth Rudyard, his first wife. Jacob and his twin brother were born Dec. 22nd, 1746. Timothy married a Miss Miller and settled in Saratoga county, N. Y. His grandson, Thomas H., lived at Ballston, N. Y., in 1880. 

The Mills on Long Island were of English descent and it would seem quite clear that they came from Yorkshire, England, to this country about 1630, locating at first in New England and some of them soon after on Long Island. The Hempstead settlement on Long Island, which began about 1644 and where the name of George Mills was found on the town records, was called a Yorkshire settlement. When Long Island was captured by the English from the Dutch they found on the west end a Yorkshire settlement called Long Island Yorkshire. 

When Jacob Mills grew up to manhood, the British law was in force here and the custom of primogeniture in full operation. In accordance with this custom his older brother fell heir to the landed estate while he was taught the trades of tanning and currying and of shoemaking, which in those days were combined together, especially on Long Island. When he was about nineteen years of age he entered upon a series of whaling voyages, going for this purpose in the spring with other young men to Nantucket and from there embarking for Greenland, as it was called, the only whaling fishery then known. These voyages lasted usually six or seven months, when he would return home and work at his trade in the winter, whipping the cat, as it was called, going from house to house. There were no wages on the vessel, but a certain portion of the cash was allotted to each one according to his position. In this way he accumulated quite a little sum during the three voyages made by him, the last one especially being quite successful. 

At just what time he came to Orange county, is not known, but it was probably between 1768 and 1770, or when from twenty-two to twenty-four years of age. He bought a tract of land four miles back of New Windsor, built himself a house and started a small tannery, conducting at the same time farming, tanning, currying and shoe-making. He lived here as a bachelor for two or three years until his marriage to Catharine Denton, of Goshen, Dec. 27th, 1773. He was not in the army during the Revolution as his trade was required to furnish shoes for the soldiers. He belonged to a militia company and when the British were coming up the Hudson river to attack Fort Montgomery, his company was suddenly ordered out to march the next morning to the defence of the Fort. He marched with the company after having worked all night to make a pair of shoes for one of the men, who was barefoot. The Fort, however, had been taken by the British before his company reached it. 

He furnished, he said, a large number of shoes for the army, but at the close of the war his money was worthless and he had to begin life anew. His place, however, was paid for and he had this advantage. 

A few years after the war, the year is not known, he sold his place in New Windsor and bought 2,250 acres in the town of Wallkill, about five miles north of Middletown and moved his family there, the place having been known for many years of late as Millsburgh. The price paid by him for his large tract of land he has been heard to say was thirteen shillings and six-pence happeny per acre in Continental money. Here he started again a tannery consisting at first of but four vats on which he could tan about two-hundred hides, but which was subsequently greatly enlarged. He at first lived on what was known as the Smith place, half a mile or more south-east of the tannery and east of the direct road leading to Scotchtown. In 1791 he built the stone house near the tannery, employing for this purpose a mason from Little Brittian, all the mortar for which building, was carried by his son Samuel, then but fifteen years of age. This house he then occupied until 1807, when he built the large frame dwelling a little north of it in which he lived with his son Charles and where he died in 1841, in the 95th year of his age. 

The stone house, tannery and farm connected therewith formerly occupied by him, he gave to his sun, Samuel. He was one of the leading persons in the erection of the Presbyteriam church at Scotchtown. Besides contributing liberally in money for this purpose he kept his team there constantly during the time of its erection. 

He had twelve children, six sons and six daughters. Seven of these were probably born in New Windsor. Jacob, jr., was born in Wallkill in 1791, the year in which the stone house was erected. All of these but one, Catharine, were married and had families of their own, All but one, Wm. Wickham, lived and died in Orange county. This one married at Mills Pond, L. I., where he subsequently lived and died. 

The grandchildren of Jacob Mills numbered 97, being evenly divided as to sex, 48 males and 49 females. The males have nearly all been farmers and the females have uniformly married farmers. Of these 97, one has been a physician, one a lawyer and one a clergyman. They have had but little aspiration for office or political distinction. Except a town office like that of roadmaster, but one among them all has held anything higher, he having served one term as Sheriff of the county of Orange. 

In addition to the Mills who settled in New England and on Long Island, referred to in this sketch, there were emigrants by this name (three, it has been said) who, in the early history of the country, settled in Virginia, and their descendants are to be found in the other southern states. Roger Q. Mills, the present U. S. Senator from Texas, (1894) says that his great grandfather, Charles Mills, lived in Hanover Co., Va. He says that he has met a number of persons by this name from the north, but has been unable to trace any relationship to them, but yet is satisfied that several generations back they all came from the same stock.
