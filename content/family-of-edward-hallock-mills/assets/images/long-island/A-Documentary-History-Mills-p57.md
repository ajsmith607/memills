  - Note that at the bottom of the page (and continued on the next page, not shown) is the note: "This James Harrison Mills, a real estate and loan broker of 446 Main St., Buffalo, N.Y., compiled an extensive pedigree of the Mills Family, and corresponded on the subject in the years 1893-1895 with Mr. Thomas Morton Paton Mills of New York City on that subject. His letters and pedigree outlines, of which this present compilation is a review and amplification, are in the possession of the latter's daughter, Mrs. Robert B. Carnahan, Jr., The Croydon, N.Y.C., 1939." Yet, note that his own family's entries starting with his father at number 167 is incomplete.
