GEORGE MILLS DIES AT 88; OLDEST HUNTINGTON VAMP 

Huntington, April 10—George Mills, 88, oldest member of the Huntington Fire Department, died yesterday at the Firemen’s Home, Hudson, N. Y. He was a native of this village, the son of the late Mr. and Mrs. J. Thomas Mills, and lived here until 14 years ago when he went to the Firemen’s Home. 

Joining the old engine company here in 1884, Mr. Mills continued with the outfit when it merged with other units to form a department and retained his membership until his death. He was foreman of the engine company for 25 years, and highly prized a gold badge presented him sometime ago in recognition of his services. 

Retaining his interest to the last in the local fire department, Mr. Mills made it a point to be present at each reunion here for the last 14 years. The trip twice a year to and from his home town was made in the local department chief's car. 

Mr. Mills was a member of Ellsworth Lodge of Odd Fellows, which he joined 45 years ago. His wife Mrs. Alice Pettit Mills, died in 1919. A brother, Alonzo Mills, died in the State Firemen’s Home several years ago. The only survivor is a sister, Mrs. Clarice Edsall of Huntington. 

Arrangements have been made by the Fire Department to have him brought to Huntington for burial.
