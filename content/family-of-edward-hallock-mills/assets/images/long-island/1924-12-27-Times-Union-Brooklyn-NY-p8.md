Woman Is Killed, Run Over By Bus

Northport Victim, Returning From Visit, Slipped as She Left Vehicle to Enter Home Nearby.

Northport, Dec. 27â€”Mrs. Mary Cross, aged 49, wife of James Cross, was killed yesterday afternoon about 1 o'clock when she fell underneath a bus of the Northport Traction Company, the rear wheel passing over her head. 

Dr. Roger Dexter, whose office is nearby, was called. Death was instantaneous.

The accident occurred in front of the Methodist Church on Main street, next door to which Mrs. Cross lived. She had boarded the bus at the railroad station, on her return from Kings Park.

The bus was operated by Kenneth Smith with Alfred Whittaker as conductor. The bus halted at the regulation stop in front of the church. Whittaker, as is his custom, stepped off the bus and assisted several passengers to the street. Mrs. Cross was the last to leave. When all was clear Whittaker stepped back into the bus which started slowly off.

The entrance and exit of the bus is at the front on the right side and it was necessary for Mrs. Cross to wait for the bus to pass to cross over to her home. When she left the bus Miss Cross walked a short distance in the opposite direction and then turned back and suddenly fell. It was thought at first she may have slipped on ice but at this particular place where the accident occurred was clear, and it is possible she was taken with a fainting spell. Coroner W. B. Gibson was notified. 

Mr. and Mrs. Cross had spent Christmas Day with Mrs. Cross' mother, Mrs Chatfield Smith at Kings Park and Mr. Cross returned home that night, but his wife remained. Mrs. Cross leaves three brothers, residents of Kings Park, J. Willis, Edgar and Henry.
