OBITUARY.

J. Thomas Mills.

One of Huntington's oldest and most highly respected residents, J. Thomas Mills, passed away early Thursday morning, at the age of 88 years. He had suffered several strokes of paralysis, and had failed gradually since the last attack, some ten days ago.

Mr. Mills was not born in Suffolk County, but he was only two weeks and two days old when he first came to old Suffolk. He first saw the light of day at Cherry street, New York City, February 13, 1827. He was the son of Jonas D. Mills and Mary Hallock, a Smithtown woman, and before he was three weeks old, his parents came up to Smithtown on a large sailing vessel, to make their home. When young Mills was 18 years of age his people apprenticed him to Samuel Scudder, in this village, to learn the tailoring trade. The shop was over the Huntington House, where many of the dandies of two generations ago secured the latest cut garments. The young man stayed with Scudder until he was married to Ann Eliza, daughter of Barney Manney, in 1848, when he secured a more lucrative position with Jonas Pearsall at the same business. After some five or six years at the Pearsall shop he gave up the trade and assisted his father-in-law, who had a nice farm at Long Swamp (as it was then called) at farming and team work. In 1871 Mr. Mills took the position as sexton of the Huntington Rural Cemetery, which place he faithfully held until 1905.

Huntington has changed most wonderfully since the time Mr. Mills plied the needle in the local tailoring shops. Then on the south side of Main street the principal buildings were Shepard's bakery, Hopper's hat store, Scudder's general country store, a shoe shop and the Suffolk Hotel, while a large locust-grove stood on the present site of the Brush block and Central Church property. On the other side of the street the principal structures were the Zophar Oakley store, near the site of the present Stevens block; Jonas Pearsall's tailoring shop, where the Goldstein store is now located; Isaac Adams' tinshop, where stands the First National Bank; the Huntington House, kept by Samuel Scudder, now conducted by A. Finnegan, and the residences of George A Scudder and Daniel Sammis. 

Eight children were born to Mr. and Mrs. Mills, of whom four are living. Mrs. Mills passed away in 1880. They are: George, Alonzo, Watts and Clarissa, the widow of Edward Etsell, all of this place.

The funeral services will be held at the home of his son, George Mills, on Wall street, with whom he lived, Saturday, at 2 o'clock, in charge of the Rev. Samuel H. Seem, pastor of the Central Presbyterian Church, of which deceased was a member. The interment will be in the Huntington Rural Cemetery.
