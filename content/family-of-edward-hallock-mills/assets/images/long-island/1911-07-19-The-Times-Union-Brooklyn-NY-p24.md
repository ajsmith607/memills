MRS. REDDY BURNED IN FRIGHTFUL MANNER 

Injuries of Severe Nature Received by Huntington Woman—Neighbors Break in to Help. 

HUNTINGTON, July 19.—Mrs, William Reddy, a young married woman of this villiage, residing on Curley avenue, is suffering from very severe burns which may result fatally. Mrs. Reddy’s clothes caught fire probably from hot coals when she emptied the grate in her kitchen stove at 6:15 last evening. Her screams attracted neighbors who rushed to her aid and who had to cut through a screen door to enter the house. Crazed by her pains, and before the neighbors could extinguish the flames, she rushed to the dooryard and was unmanageable, running around as the flames burned her clothes all off, save her corsets. Her body, legs, hands and arms were frightfully burned, but her face escaped with but slight injury. 

Physicians were attending to her within a_ very few minutes after she was burned.  

Mrs. Reddy, who was Miss Sarah Mills, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Alonzo Mills, has a nine-months-old baby.
