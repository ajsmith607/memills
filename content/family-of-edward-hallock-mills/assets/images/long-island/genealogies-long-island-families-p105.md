    - Timothy Mills' will exists presently in the Mills Family Collection of Queens Public Library. The will is also transcribed in the volume <em>A Documentary History of the Family of Mills</em>, beginning p33a.

    - The last paragraph is liberally quoted in <em>A Documentary History of the Family of Mills</em>, p30, with an implicit parenthetical reference indicating that "present" is 1919. The only other difference is that the later source begins: "The settlement known as Mills Pond, so named for this Timothy Mills, is a collection of dignified old houses..."

This genealogy relates to the Suffolk County branch of the family, descendants of TIMOTHY MILLS who settled at Smithtown in 1693. The other branch remained at Jamaica. Members of both branches were fairly numerous during the 18th and first half of the 19th centuries, but are now greatly reduced. 

Among the early settlers of Jamaica L. I. was GEORGE MILLS<sup>1</sup> born in 1585 and died aged 89, Oct. 17, 1674 at Jamaica. He was probably a descendant of John Mills who was made freeman of Boston in 1632. Children were Samuel<sup>2</sup> and Nathaniel<sup>2</sup> who d. Nov. 4, 1728.

SAMUEL MILLS<sup>2</sup> was born in 1631, md. in 1658 and was reputed to have had 16 children. He died at Jamaica March 9, 1726, aged 95. Among his children was Timothy.<sup>3</sup> 

TIMOTHY MILLS<sup>3</sup> (Samuel<sup>2</sup>) born at Jamaica in 1667, was the progenitor of the Suffolk Co. Mills and moved to that part of Smithtown since called Mills Pond in 1693. He died March 30th 1751 aged 84. His will bears date of March 16, 1741. He married first Elizabeth, family name unknown and secondly Sarah Longbotham. 

The settlement of Mills Pond is a collection of dignified old houses surrounded by a small pond situated on the North Country road about four miles east of the village of Smithtown Branch. It lies within the town of Smithtown and has always been the residence of one or more members of the family since the days of Timothy Mills the common ancestor. Mr. Dubois Smith, a grandson of William Wickham Mills, is the present owner of the Pond and the Mills homestead.
