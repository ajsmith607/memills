Bus Kills Woman Said To Be Dazed

Northport, L. I., Dec. 27â€”Mrs. Mary Cross, 49, wife of James Cross, is dead at her home here today as the result of an unusual accident. She was run over by a local bus and, according to Dr. Roger Dexter, died instantly.

Mrs. Cross returned last evening from Kings Park, where she had visited her mother and brothers over Christmas. Other Northport passengers on the train from Kings Park say she gave indications of being dazed. She took the bus a the local station and descended from it before her home. She took two steps away from the vehicle then turned and walked into it. She plunged under the rear wheel as the vehicle started off. 

The bus was driven by Kenneth Smith, assisted by George Whittaker.
