It is clear, from the document dated "November ye 25th 1656", quoted on page 2 hereof, that GEORGE MILLS was one of the seventeen residents of Hempstead, L.I., who before February 18th. of that year had purchased from the Indians the tract adjacent to be named Jamaica, and later, on "the 10th. of March 1656", petitioned Governor Pieter Stuyvesant at New Amsterdam for his confirmation to them of this purchase.*
