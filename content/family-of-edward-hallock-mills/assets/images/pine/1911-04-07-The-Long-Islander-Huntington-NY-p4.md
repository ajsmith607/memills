OBITUARY. 

Mrs. Juliette Loper Shepard. 

After an invalidism of several years Mrs. Juliette Loper Shepard, wife of Charles E. Shepard, editor of this paper, peacefully slept her life away Sunday morning at 9:30 o’clock. She died from paralysis, having had several shocks previous to the one Friday morning, which finally terminated in her death. Mrs. Shepard was born in Farmingdale, L. I. January 6, 1845, being the daughter of Erastus H. and Caroline Loper. Her early life was spent in New York City, and following the death of her father in 1860 the family moved to this place. She was married to Mr. Shepard November 28, 1872, and three children were born to them. George, the only son, died in childhood, and the other two survive, They are: Caroline, wife of Raymond S. Spears of Little Falls, N. Y., and Jessie L., an instructress in an institution for the blind in New York City. Mrs. Shepard also leaves two sisters, Mrs. William Sinell of Spring Valley, N. Y.; Mrs. Walter E. Bryant of this village, and two brothers, Edward H. Loper and William H. Loper, also of Huntington. 

Early in life Mrs. Shepard united with the First Presbyterian Church and later, upon the inception of the Central Presbyterian Church, joined that organization. There are very few members, if any, who have been as devoted to the work of the church as Mrs. Shepard. As long as her health permitted she was a faithful attendant upon its services, and when she was unable to go her thoughts were centered upon the things of God’s house. Being enthusiastic upon the subject of missions, she was many years secretary and treasurer of the Ladies’ Missionary Society of the Central Presbyterian Church. Even up to the day of her death she was formulating plans along missionary lines. Her heart went out to the poor and many a local family will miss her little acts of kindness which she did without show or ostentation. 

She was for many years a member of Dorcas Circle of King’s Daughters of this village, which sent a large number of gifts to the miners in Michigan and to the sick in hospitals and tenements, and she continuously sent supplies to city missions. She was also for many years an active worker for temperance in the ranks of the W. C. T. U, and a member of Ketewamoke Chapter, D. A. R. 

The funeral services were held at the Central Presbyterian Church Tuesday afternoon at 2 o'clock, the Rev. Samuel H. Seem being in charge. The interment was in the Huntington Rural Cemetery.
