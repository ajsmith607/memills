citation: "08 Apr 1856, Last Will and Testament of Luther Loper, ancestry.com."
notes: >-

  - The will states that it is "the petition of Charles M. Pine of Castleton Richmond County that Luther Loper of Hempstead in Queens County, departed this life, at said town, on the fifth day of April 1856..."

  - The continues: "the deceased left him surviving as his only heirs at law and next of kin, a widow, Sarah Loper of Hempstead, Queens County, and six children..." From this, we can see how the "L" in Loper might be mistaken for an "S".
