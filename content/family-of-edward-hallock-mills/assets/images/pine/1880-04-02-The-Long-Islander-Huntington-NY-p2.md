Mr. Samuel M. Pine, aged 67 years, of Hempstead, father of Mr. A. B. Pine, editor of the *L. I. Farmer*, died at his residence at Hempstead, of pneumonia. The *Sentinel* remarks: “By his death our village loses a worthy and upright citizen, the business community a man of strict integrity, the Presbyterian Church one of its most exemplary members, and his family an affectionate and self-denying husband and father.”
