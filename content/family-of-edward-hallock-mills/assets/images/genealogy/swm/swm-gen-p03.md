He had 16 children nine of whom were living at the time of his death, 80 grand children and fifty four great-grand-children. Jonathan Mills, who lived at Jamaica and whose wife was Martha, was probably a son of George. 

The date of his birth and death are not known. On March 30, 1677, he bought of Jonas Halstead and his son Joseph, a piece of land owned by them jointly. His wife, Martha, was living in 1710 as well as himself. They had four children, Timothy, Samuel, Isaac and Jonathan Jr. Of these Timothy was born in 1667 and moved from Jamaica to Mills Pond, four miles from Smithtown about 1705, the first of the name to locate there, and where he died March 30, 1751. By his first wife Elizabeth he had two children, and by his second, Sarah, eleven. Of these eleven, the sixth was Jonathan, who was born Oct. 23, 1710, who was the father of Jacob Mills born Dec. 22, 1746 and who subsequently settled in the Town of New Windsor Orange Co, N.Y. 

Jonathon Mills married April 3, 1737, Ruth Rudyard, daughter of John Rudyard of Perth Amboy, N.J. by whom he had six children. On January 25, 1756 he married Dorothy Miller, his second wife, by whom he had three children. He lived at Mills Pond where he died Oct? 23, 1798. Of the six children by his first wife, Jacob and Timothy were twins. The first person by the name of Mills (of the Long Island Mills's) who settled in Orange County of whom we have any account, was Timothy, son of Timothy the first settler at Mills Pond by his second wife, Sarah. He married Margaret Rudyard, daughter of John Rudyard of Perth Amboy N.J. About 1752 a division of his fathers land on L.I. was made and he appears to have left Mills
