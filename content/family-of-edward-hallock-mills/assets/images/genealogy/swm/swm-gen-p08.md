  - The transcription of "N." in "N. Hampton" below is based on a very similar handwritten "N" on page 10 for Nancy, wife of William Gale, who is the son of Juliana and John Gale. An example of a handwritten capital "S" can be seen in the reference to Suffolk County below. Also note that I corrected Mechanicstown, which appears to be written "Mechanic-town".
