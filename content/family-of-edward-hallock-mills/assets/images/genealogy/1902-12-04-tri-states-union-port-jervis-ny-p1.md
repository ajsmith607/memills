THE REV. S. W. MILLS 

Death of this Venerable Citizen at 6.06 Thursday Evening. 

HIS LIFE WORK IN THIS VALLEY 

A Man of Deep Religious Conviction, of High Moral Standards, and a Public Benefactor — A Sketch of the Mills Family. 

The Rev. S. W. Mills, D. D., who bas been lying critically ill at his home, No. 47 West Main street, died at six minutes past 6 o’clock last Thursday night. 

On Saturday afternoon last, Dr. Mills received a stroke of paralysis which affected the entire left portion of his body. It was evident at the time that his recovery would not be likely, and the members of his family residing out of town were sent for and arrived here shortly afterwards. 

Shortly after the stroke the venerable doctor partially regained consciousness, recognizing the different members of his family, but on Sunday he sunk into a lethargic condition, and from that time life gradually ebbed away until his death last Thursday night. 

THE MILLS FAMILY HISTORY. 

Brief Sketch of One of the Oldest Families in this State. 

Samuel Wickham Mills, D, D., was a native of Orange county, born in the town of Wallkill, near Scotchtown, five miles north of Middletown, on the 5th of April, 1820, and was a son of Samuel and Esther Stitt Mills. His mother was a daughter of John and Nancy McCullough Stitt, of Bloomingburg, Sullivan county. 

The Mills family came from Yorkshire, England. Some of the names are of Holland extraction, the first to come to America being Peter Vander Mulin (the name meaning from the mills) who settled in Windsor, Conn., where the family took the English name of Mills. 

The English family can be traced back to the DeMolis, founded in 1003, in Devon, England, the name being derived from Meulles of Normandy. Members of the family bearing that name went to England with William the Conqueror in 1066. The name has several times been changed, being Milne in 1530, Mills in 1560, Miline an 1584, Milles in 1612, and Mylle from 1627 to 1665, these being found in the records of Yorkshire, England. 

John Mills came with Governor Winthrop to Massachusetts in 1629 or 1630, his name appearing 33rd on the roll of the First Church of Boston, in which his two daughters, Joy and Remembrance, were baptized in October, 1630. He became a freeman of Boston in 1632, but later removed to Braintree, Mass., where he served as Township Clerk in 1653. His will was made in 1670, and he left his estate to his son John, asking also that one of John’s sons be educated for the ministry, as many of his predecessors were of that profession. 

Richard Mills was a pioneer on Long Island and in Connecticut. Samuel Mills, of Dedham, Mass., and Samuel Mills, of Windsor, Conn., came from England at an early date, but it is not known whether they were related to the branch of the family to which our subject belongs. George Mills, who was probably the ancestor of the Long Island Branch, came from Yorkshire, England, about 1663, and died in Jamaica, L, I., in 1694, at the age of 89 years, He is supposed to have been a brother of John Mills, of Boston. 

From George, in a direct line to our subject, are Samuel, Jonathan, Timothy, Jonathan, Jacob and Samuel, the latter the father of our subject. George’s son, Samuel, was born on Long Island in 1631, and died at Jamaica, L.I., in 1726, at the age of 95 years, a notice of his death appearing in the New York Gazette, March 12, 1726. He had 16 children, nine of whom were living at the time of his death, together with 80 grandchildren and 54 great grandchildren. His son Jonathan was born at Jamaica, N. Y., was married in 1710, and had four children: Timothy, Samuel, Isaac, Jonathan. The records show that he purchased a piece of land March 8, 1677. 

Timothy, born in 1677, left Jamaica and settled at Mills Pond in 1693, to which he gave the name. He died March 30, 1751. His first wife, Elizabeth, had two children, and the second wife Sarah, had 11. Jonathan,the sixth of the latter marriage, was born October 23, 1710, and was married in 1737, to Ruth Rudyard, of Perth Amboy, N.J. They had six children, and after her death he was married again, January 25, 1756, this time to Dorothy Miller, and to them were born three children. His death occurred at Mills’ Pond, October 23, 1798. Of the first marriage, Jacob and Timothy were twins, born December 22 1746, 

Samuel Mills, the father of the Rev. S. W. Mills, succeeded to the old home place. He was born August 27, 1776, and died on the 13th of November, 1860, at the age of 85. He cast his Last vote just before his death. On the 13th of January 1807, he married Esther Stitt, who was born August 28, 1787, and her death occurred November 11, 1863. Of their family we note the following: Catherine married Archibald Slaughter, and died June 8, 1888, in her 81st year; Nancy, wife of Hiram S. Dunning, died in her 34th year, March 3, 1843; William, died October 31, 1885, at Petersburgh, Va., in his 76th year; Caroline, wife of DeWitt Slaughter, died November 9, 1861, in her 50th year; Mary Jane, the wife of Robert. J. Bull, of Walllkill, died in her 85th year; John Stitt died when young; Sarah Elizabeth, who was the wife of Gen. Alfred D. Hurtin, died April 24, 1896, in her 70th year; Jacob Stitt passed away when young; Samuel Wickham is next in order of birth; James Jackson lives at Middletown in his 81st year; Alfred died on the old homestead in his 66th year, July 25, 1899, where his widow still resides; Edwin died at Phillipsburgh, this county; and Ruth died in childhood. 

The father of this family carried on a tannery. He also engaged in farming, and owned a large tract of land which comprised three farms. He was a successful business man, and assisted his children very materially.  

At the age of 19 Jacob Mulls began whaling, which he followed for six or seven mouths out of the year. He came to Orange county between 1768 and 1770, near New Windsor, and started a tannery. When he first moved here he bought 2,250 acres of land in the town of Wallkill, seven miles north of Middletown, and the place was known as Millsburg. On the 27th of December, 1773, he was married, in Goshen, to Catherine Denton. During the Revolutionary War he made shoes for the soldiers of the militia company to which he belonged, and received his pay in Continental money, which was worth but very little. His company was ordered to Ft. Montgomery, but it was captured before they arrived. 

His tannery was enlarged, and in 1791 he built a stone house near the same. He occupied that house until 1807, when he erected a large frame dwelling. He died at the home of his son, Charles, in 1842, at the age of 95 years. He was a liberal man and assisted largely in building the Presbyterian Church at Scotchtown. 

In his family were twelve children, six sons and six daughters, and with the exception of Catherine, all reared families of their own. William Wickham was the only one that did not live in Orange county. He made his home on Long Island, where he was heir to his uncle’s property at Mills’ Pond. 

At the time of his death Jacob Mills had 97 grandchildren, 48 grandsons, and 49 granddaughters, nearly all of whom became farmers. There was one physician, one clergyman, and one sheriff of Orange county. 

The Rev. Samuel W. Mills was ninth in the family, and remained at home until reaching the age of 15, when he entered Rutgers College at New Brunswick, N. J., from which he was graduated in the class of '38, at the age of 18. He spent the succeeding year at home, and then entered the Theological Seminary of the Reformed Church at New Brunswick, from which he was graduated in 1842. Among his classmates at Rutgers there were many who afterward became noted, among them being John DeWitt, who became Professor of Ancient Languages at the Theological Seminary at New Brunswick ; Theodoris R. Westbrook, Supreme Judge of New York, who made his home at Kingston, this state, and died while serving on the bench;  and Dr. James A. H. Cornell, a minister of New Baltimore, N. Y., who has been prominent in church work in the state. Upon his graduation from college he was awarded the English salutatory, which at that time was third in the list of honors conferred by the faculty of the college. 

In the year 1874 the degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred upon Mr. Mills by the trustees of Rutger’s College. 

At Bloomingburgh, Sullivan county, in May, 1848, Mr. Mills was ordained and began his pastoral work. At the end of 15 years he located in Port Jervis, where he engaged in preaching for 14 years, or until 1872, the date of his arrival here being in February, 1858. During his pastorate the present Reformed Church edifice was erected. 

During his ministry he received 249 members into the church.

Of late years he had no charge, but did supply duty, and preached in nearly all the churches in this section of the country. He was a member of the chassis of Orange, in the higher judicatories of the Reformed Church, and during his pastorates, as well as since, had represented the same. He served as president of the Minisink Valley Historical Society since its organization in 1889. For 37 years, or up to June, 1895, he was corresponding secretary of the Orange County Bible Society, and then was made president of the society. 

Rev. Mr. Mills was married on the 17th of January, 1844, to Misa Almeda J. Bailey, of Middletown, a daughter of Nathaniel Bailey, of the same city. She was born February 28, 1822 and her death occurred on the 12th of March, 1867. By her marriage she became the mother of six children: Harriet Bailey Mills, who died in childhood on the 2nd of April, 1847; Esther, wife of C. E. Cuddeback, an attorney of Port Jervis; Anna, whose death occurred April 5. 1879, at the age of 29 years; Theodore Denton Mills, a doctor of Middletown; Cornelia Hunter, who died November 24, 1871, at the age of 17 years; and Mary Delia, wife of J. Alex. Stitt, an attorney of New York City.  

On the 29th of November, 1870, Rev. Mr. Mills was again married, Miss Amira St. John becoming his wife. She is a daughter of the late Stephen St. John, of Port Jervis. 

Mr. Mills became a member of the Classis of Orange, May 30, 1848. Of those who were members at that time, he was, at the time of his death, the only surviving member. He had been a faithful attendant at Classis, and when he missed the session of April 17, 1900, at New Hurley, resolutions of regret were adopted by the Classis. 

Mr. Mills was a well read, cultured gentleman, and a natural pulpit orator. His record has been an honorable one, his years have been fruitful with deeds of usefulness and kindness, with malice towards none, and friendliness towards all who have come under his influence, and he gained the respect and honor of the whole community. His later years were passed in his handsome residence on West Main street, lying at the foot of the mountain, which looms grandly above it for several hundred feet, and is surrounded by beautiful grounds. In this lovely spot the remaining days of his well-rounded life were spent. 

A USEFUL CITIZEN. 

Scholarly, and a Life Devoted to the Good of his Fellow Men. 

Rev. Samuel W. Mills, D. D., was one of the most prominent citizens, not only of the village of Port Jervis, but of the county of Orange and of the Reformed Church, in America. His influence was felt not only in the church of which he was for so many years the pastor, and the community in which he lived, but also in the organized efforts for good in the county, prominently in its Bible Society of which for many years he was an officer, and in the higher courts of his church, in whose councils no voice had more weight or influence. 

His personal character was distinguished for its purity. “The white flower of a blameless life;” for its integrity manifested in his unflinching adherence to the truth as he conceived it; and for its breadth, shown in the wide range of interests that occupied his mind and effort. 

As a Christian minister he was distinguished by an unwavering faith in the word of God, and an unswerving confidence that in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and in it alone, there could be found a panacea for the ills by which humanity is afflicted. He was scholarly in his attainments and had a keen appreciation of all that was best in life time, and possessed the faculty of conveying in thoughts to other minds in cogent and convincing language. His preaching was reinforced by his examples. Like the parson of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, “Christ law he preached, but first he followed it himself.” 

His pastorate in Port Jervis, where his principle life work was done, was one of especial importance to the church. Under his leadership it passed from a position of comparative insignificance to become one of the foremost and influential the denomination. To his tactful guidance and clear insight into human nature this result must in a large measure be attributed.  

Whilst Dr. Mills was strongly attached to his denomination an firmly convinced of the importance of the truth it taught, he was no bigot, but was ever very quick to note and recognize any influences that made for righteousness and to extend to it generous recognition and sympathetic help.  

Time would fail us to make mention of his generosity to the poor, his liberality in the support of every good work, his untiring efforts in behalf of every movement that was made for civic or social betterment. 

Suffice it to say that the life of our community is on a distinctly higher plane today than it otherwise would have been, because in the Providence of God he lived in it.

RESOLUTIONS OF THE MINISTERIAL ASSOCIATION. 

The Port Jervis Ministerial Association, having learned that the Reverend Samuel Wickham Mills, D. D., had entered into rest since their last meeting, adopted the following minute: 

1t has pleased the Lord to say unto our brother, “Lay aside the garment of flesh and enter into the joy of thy Lord”; Therefore, We, the Ministers of Port Jervis and vicinity, as fellow servants of the same Lord, laboring for a little while longer in the vineyard, and waiting until for us also the shadows shall flee away, rejoice that for our brother there are no more shadows, no more labor, no more sorrow, since he has entered into the presence of the King and the rest which remaineth for the people of God. 

Yet, while we sorrow not as those who have no hope, we do grieve that we shall see his face no more on this earth. We shall miss him. For in him were comfort and counsel, and consolation. 

We rejoice that while our Lord and Master hath gone into the heavens to prepare a place for us, He hath not left us comfortless, for the Spirit has come into the world to be our advocate, guide, and counsellor. No where more mightly does the Spirit of God reveal his workings than in the lives of the Saints, and we grieve that a vessel of mercy—a true temple of the spirit—has been taken from us in the person of our brother. The public press has fittingly given its tribute of appreciation in regard to the civic, the moral and the religious excellences of our brother—to all of which we, as fellow soldiers with him, say Amen. 

“Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors and their works do follow them.”  

It was resolved that copies of this minute be made and sent to the press. Also, that the association, through its Secretary, express its sympathy with those who are so sorely bereaved by this dispensation of Oar God.
