  - "This genealogy relates to the Suffolk County branch of the family, descendants of TIMOTHY MILLS who settled at Smithtown in 1683. The other branch remained at Jamaica. Members of both branches were fairly numerous during the 18th and first half of the 19th centuries, but now are greatly reduced." (p105.)

  - Jonas' parents: [George Phillips Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/25193050/george-phillips-mills) (23 Aug 1765 to 18 Mar 1846) and [Tabitha Davis Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/103243323/tabitha-mills) (16 Feb 1774 to 11 Jan 1830).

  - [Sarah Ann (Hallock) Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/127233833/sarah-ann-mills) (29 Aug 1812 to 22 Apr 1897), who married Jonas Mills' brother [George Phillips Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/127233764/george-phillips-mills) (31 May 1801 to 06 Mar 1868) appears to be Mary Hallock's sister. Both appear to be referenced as daughters of [Thomas Hallock](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/240646827/thomas-hallock) (11 Jul 1768 to 07 Jan 1854) of Smithtown. 


  - Jonas and Mary Platt are cousins.  They share common grandparents [Isaac Mills Jr.](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/68730036/isaac-mills) (19 Feb 1727 to 23 Apr 1783) and [Sarah (Phillips) Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/187300487/sarah-mills) (26 Feb 1731 to 29 Apr 1790), who are themselves first cousins. (Sarah Phillips' parents are [George Phillips](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/25501640/george-phillips) (1698 to 21 Nov 1771) and [Elizabeth (Mills) Phillips](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/25501594/elizabeth-phillips) (1706 to 19 Apr 1775).) Isaac and Sarah's son [George Phillips Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/25193050/george-phillips-mills) (23 Aug 1765 to 18 Mar 1846) is Jonas' father and Isaac and Sarah's daughter [Elizabeth (Mills) Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/68731488/elizabeth-mills) (17 Apr 1763 to [12 or 15] Jul 1826) is Mary Platt's mother. Elizabeth's grandfather, Isaac Mills Sr. was her husband Jedediah Mills' father's half brother. 

  - More than one source corroborates that Emily Tabitha Mills married John Smith Huntting on 14 Dec 1843.

  - As noted elsewhere, Edward H. Mills' brother, born 13 Feb 1827, is James Thomas Mills.
