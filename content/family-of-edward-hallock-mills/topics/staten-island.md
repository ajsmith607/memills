title: "The Mills Family in Staten Island NY"
weight: 400

Edward and Mary Ann began their marriage in Staten Island NY where they lived throughout the 1850's and where each Mills child was born. Here, Edward presumably learned the grocery business from Mary Ann's brother, [Charles Mills Pine](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199952123/charles-m-pine) (1812 to 08 Oct 1897), who subsequently co-owned E. H. Mills & Co. in Corfu. Edward presumably worked in Pine's general store, which  was located in West New Brighton, also known as Factoryville, a neighborhood in the Staten Island town of Castleton, and was known as Pine, Hillyer & Co. and then C. M. Pine & Son. The Mills are members of the Reformed Dutch Church of Port Richmond, where Charles M. Pine was a longtime member of the church consistory. This section also explores related Pine family members in Staten Island as well as associates in the Loper, Hillyer, Brown, Egbert and Mersereau families. Finally, the Civil War service of Charles' son Theodore, and Theodore's cousins are also explored through surviving letters between his cousins Milton Loper and Juliett (Loper) Shepard.

It appears that Edward Mills first met Mary Ann and Charles M. Pine when he moved with his family to [Hempstead]({{% relref "hempstead" %}}) in the mid-late 1830's and Edward's move to Staten Island may have coincided with the establishment of Charles' grocery business, incorporated there in 1848. When Edward and Mary Ann married in 1850, Edward is said to be "of Factoryville", the Staten Island neighborhood where Charles M. Pine's store was located.

Multiple census records confirm that all the Mills' children were born in Staten Island, and they were baptized in the Reformed Dutch Church of Port Richmond.

Every child's baptism was performed on a Friday except for Emily's. This may be a subtle clue to narrow Emily's exact birthdate to early in December, possibly as early as the first, the following day. 

| Child Baptized | Date Recorded | Day of Week |

| Jonas  | 30 Jul 1852 | Friday |
| Horace | 04 May 1855 | Friday |

I continue to search for the birth dates for James and Emily, but these may be lost forever.

<blockquote>
<p>
The "Old Town" collection contains record of births that occurred in the Towns of Northfield, Southfield and Westfield for 1847-1865. The births were recorded in libers (not certificates) and are available on microfilm in room 103. The Municipal Archives does not have records for the rest of Richmond County for the period in question. 
<p>
</p>
I have researched the records available here for the three births and unfortunately found none of them. Despite the law passed in 1847 mandating recordkeeping of vital records in NY State, and subsequent updates to the law, it wasn't until after new legislation in 1919  that the recording of births were enforced. Knowing that, there may not be a NY State birth record.

James Wheelock Mills apparently died as a young child sometime between his 31 July 1857 baptism and the 1860 United States Federal Census in Castleton, Staten Island NY which shows the Mills family otherwise complete except for James, living at the residence of [Bartlett Brown](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199802084/bartlett-brown) (1833 to 24 Nov 1902), another protege of Charles M. Pine in the grocery business, and later, Bartlett succeeded Charles as President of the Richmond County Mutual Insurance Company.

{{% fig "census/census-1860-us" "800" /%}}

The 1860 census indicates the town is Castleton. Castleton is the name of one of the original four towns of Staten Island and Factoryville was the colloquial name at the time of one its neighborhoods, West New Brighton.

<figure class="quote-only">

 According to the following tax assessment, Bartlett also lists Factoryville in the "Residence" column.

Bartlett Brown was born in Oak Farm on Long Island NY and according to the 1850 census, when Bartlett was 17 years old and still in school, he and his family were living in Huntington on Long Island NY. He then moved, first to Brooklyn, then onto Castleton in Staten Island NY by 1857 to work at Pine's general store. It seems likely that Bartlett made considerable money in business in Brooklyn, and his time in Pine's store would seem to be a sort of apprenticeship, as after only a few years, he moved on to purchase prime Staten Island real estate and begin his own store, which he successfully ran for several decades.

Based on the 1860 census, and assuming Bartlett's obituary is accurate, we can surmise the Mills were residing with Bartlett at "the adjoining house" to "the valuable property at the corner of Broadway and Castleton Avenue". The Beers map from 1874 shows "B Brown" in the southwest corner of the intersection at Broadway and Castleton, and the "adjoining house" referred to is most likely the structure shown at the corner of State Street and Castleton Avenue, or possibly the one next to it, both of which are labelled as "DWG." on the 1885 Sanborn map.

The Sanborn map clearly labels Brown's store as  grocery and dry goods, "Gro. & D. G.", with an accompanying warehouse ("W. Ho.").

{{% fig "staten-island/1885-sanborn-p26" "800" /%}}

{{% fig "staten-island/1885-sanborn-p1" "500" /%}}

The representation of the property on some maps does seem to show these two corner structures were "adjoined" in later years.

{{% fig "staten-island/topo-brown" "500" /%}}

The following are Google Maps street view images of Bartlett Brown's property, captured in 2022.

Webb's Consolidated Directory of Staten Island from 1886 lists Brown’s general store, referencing 114 Broadway, the address mentioned in his obituary,  as well as a reference to the home on State Street "near" Castleton Avenue. This description opens the possibility of a different interpretation of which building was the home: as the directory legend below shows, there is an abbreviation for "corner" which would seem to be more appropriate than "near" in this case, and the Beers map indicates Bartlett owned the other lots on that block (although those other lots could have been purchased after the Mills left Staten Island, obviously), so perhaps the home the Mills lived in was the building immediately below the highlighted one, number 424 on the Sanborn map, which is also described as a "DWG". (Or perhaps Brown moved into that home at a later time?)

{{% fig "staten-island/1886-staten-island-directory-p117" "500" /%}}

{{% fig "staten-island/1886-webbs-consolidated-directory-p65" "500" /%}}

But if I understand the maps and references correctly, Brown's main storefront faced Broadway and the front of the home faced the opposite direction onto State Street, where the Sanborn map seems to indicate a porch. 

Other maps showing this property include the Colton and Dripps maps which both indicate only three structures on that block:

{{% fig "staten-island/1866-colton-map-cropped" "800" /%}}
{{% fig "staten-island/1872-dripps-map-cropped" "800" /%}}

Bartlett Brown's store at the corner of Castleton Avenue and Broadway in Staten Island was addressed as 114 Broadway in the 1800's, but as I write this, it is addressed as 280 Broadway, block 206, lot 13 (Borough-Block-Lot Lookup, New York City Department of Finance).

Bartlett Brown's son [Bartlett Brown Jr.](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199802139/bartlett-brown) (04 Mar 1870 to 15 Dec 1946), apparently known locally as "Bartie", succeeded him in business:

A partial timeline of events in Staten Island while the Mills lived there:

<figure class="quote-only">
<blockquote>

The quarantine buildings were burned just a few months before Emily was born. The following figures are taken from 1950, *Staten Island 1524-1898* by Henry G. Steinmeyer, and show that in the by the time that Edward and Mary Ann left Staten Island in the early 1860's, the population of the island roughly doubled from when they arrived in the late 1840's. 

| Year | Population |
| --- | --- |
| 1840 | 10,965 |
| 1850 | 15,961 |
| 1860 | 25,492 |
| 1870 | 33,629 |
| 1880 | 38,950 |
| 1890 | 51,693 |
| 1900 | 67,021 |

The early 1860’s were a time of significant life changes for both Bartlett Brown and the Mills family. Bartlett Brown started a new grocery store, married a few months after the census was taken, and started a family of his own, as documented in the records of the Reformed Dutch Church and the 1865 census. The Mills moved to Corfu sometime between the Summer of 1862 and the Spring of 1863, during a period in which the Battle of Antietam in Sharpsburg MD was fought just a few hundred miles southwest of Castleton, and just before the draft riots on Staten Island. 

{{% fig "staten-island/RDC/rdc-scan_151-p144" "800" /%}}

{{% fig "staten-island/census-1865-nys-brown" /%}}

Bartlett honored his former employer and friend by naming his *first* son after him: Charles Pine Brown (25 Jan 1866 to 22 Jan 1887) who died of tuberculosis in West New Brighton three days before his 21st birthday. (1887, New York State Death Index, Certificate number 41287, New York Department of Health, Albany, NY, ancestry.com.) Bartlett named his second son after himself. 

{{% fig "staten-island/RDC/rdc-scan_083" "800" /%}}

Edward and Bartlett appeared to work together at Charles Pine's store, and perhaps Edward worked for Bartlett as Bartlett was first starting his own store. Whatever role, if any, Edward had in Bartlett's new store, it seems reasonable to assume that seeing his co-worker take this risk, and perhaps seeing the process first-hand, must have only encouraged Edward to take an even bigger risk just a few years later when he also started his own store in [Corfu NY]({{% relref "corfu" %}}). 

As described in that section, Charles M. Pine and James A. Hillyer (1831/2 to 20 Mar 1925) were listed as co-owners of E. H. Mills & Co. in Corfu:

{{% fig "corfu/1869-Gazetteer-Business-Directory-Genesee-County-inset" "500" /%}}

(James M. Hillyer is a presumed misprint of James A. Hillyer.)

Charles M. Pine is Mary Ann Mills' brother. He married Elmira (sometimes spelled "Almira") Jane Loper in 1835 in South Hempstead, New York. It was just two years later that Edward likely moved with his father Jonas to Hempstead, also known as South Hempstead. 

{{% fig "staten-island/1835-02-21-charles-pine" "800" /%}}

{{% fig "staten-island/martha-deed/elmira" "800" /%}}

Weekes, Seaman & Pine was a general store in Hempstead, possibly with some of the same partners as the previous firm of Weekes, Seaman & Co. in the same village:

Charles M. Pine was a prominent and prolific business man who was a central figure in the lives of many other successful proteges and business partners that included Edward Mills, Bartlett Brown, James Hillyer, Mark Hartley, and Charles' own sons, [Charles Theodore "Theodore" Pine](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/26215884/charles-theodore-pine) (1839 to 28 May 1895) and [Alverade Richmond Pine](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199952865/alvarade-r-pine) (1850 to 21 Aug 1929).

</div>

Charles M. Pine continued his grocery career in Staten Island starting in 1848, and the Beers map (explored further below) confirms what other histories describe, that there are two stores associated with Charles Pine: C. M. Pine & Co., as well as the location next to his residence that was known earlier as Pine, Hillyer & Co. and later as C. M. Pine & Son. Presumably, Edward Mills worked for Charles at least some of the time that he lived in Staten Island, and it seems likely Edward moved to Castleton because of Charles. Edward may have worked at either or both locations.

"Squire John" [Bodine] owned considerable property on the North Shore, among which was the mill, and the pond, and the land east of it, including the old Dongan Manor house, which he subsequently sold to his father, who died in that house in 1835. He also owned the property now occupied by the store of Pine, Hillyer & Co., the residence of Mr. C. M. Pine, and the dwelling west of it, in which he lived at the time of his decease.

Charles' occupation is "merchant" in Castleton in the 1850 Federal census, and James Hillyer lives with the Pine family, as a clerk, presumably also working in Charles' store. This might suggest that James is not actually the "Hillyer" being indicated in the store's name, but one of his relatives who were also known to be in the same line of work. And it is perhaps relevant that roughly coinciding with the establishment of Charles M. Pine's store James Hillyer's grandfather John Hillyer as well as Nathaniel Seaman, both died in 1848. However, other clues seem consistent with James being the indicated co-owner, as he seems to be referred to as such when he is said to be "of the firm Pine Hillyer & Co." and the rough timeline I am aware of seems consistent with the store's name changing after he left to form Hillyer & Egbert.

Both the 1850 and 1860 census show [George Mersereau](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/182609528/george-mersereau) (24 Apr 1835 to 08 Mar 1896) also living with the family of Charles Pine. Charles appears to have taken over the general store in Staten Island from George Mersereau's father and brother, and George worked as a clerk for Charles for some time. George was a Civil War veteran, and he went on to become successful in business himself; in several places he is credited with rebuilding St. Andrews Church, although his obituary doesn't explicitly mention this.

Anglicans established the Church of St. Andrew at the head of the Fresh Kills in the early 18th century. A graveyard and church were begun by 1709 and the stone church building completed in 1712, adding a major institutional presence to the growing hamlet of Richmond. The church was granted its charter by Queen Anne in 1713.
</p>
<p>
In 1770 the original church building was enlarged and a tall, elegant steeple was added. The steeple followed a design published by the English architect James Gibbs. With its location on a hill adding to the effect of the tall steeple, the church became an important monument that was visible from miles away.
</p>
<p>
During the American Revolution, the church was a center of military activity. Rev. Richard Charlton, who was a rector of St. Andrew’s at the start of the Revolution (until 1777), is remembered as the grandfather of Saint Elizabeth Ann Bayley Seton, who was the first native-born U.S. citizen to be canonized by the Roman Catholic Church; Charlton and Seton family members are among the distinguished early citizens whose graves can be found in the church’s cemetery.
</p>
<p>
The early church building was severely damaged by fire on March 29, 1867 and again in October 1872. During the periods of rebuilding, services were held in the nearby Reformed Dutch Church.
</p>
<p>
Today, the Episcopal Church of St. Andrew is an active faith community. The current structure, attributed to builder George Mersereau in 1872, is noted for the English influences in its design. It was designated a New York City landmark in 1967 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. The adjoining Burch Hall was built in 1924.

In 1865, Mark Hartley is also living with Charles M. Pine, occupation "clerk", presumably in Pine's general store. Later, Mark Hartley co-owned the general store Hillyer & Hartley, along with James Hillyer's brother Abraham Hillyer. Later still, Mark Hartley became Charles M. Pine's assignee when Charles' store failed.

{{% fig "pine/1865-census-nys" "800" /%}}

By 1859, Charles' general store is known as Pine, Hillyer & Co., presumably co-owned with James Hillyer. The 1874 Beers map shows "General Store of Pine, Hillyer & Co.", in an area described below as "the bend between Van Street and Broadway" at 188 Richmond Terrace (also called "Shore Road", at least to the west of Pine's store). Comparing a number of historical maps of Castleton to present day maps, it is striking how the major road names and their courses have remained consistent over these many years, as exemplified by the bends in this stretch of Richmond Terrace.

The 1885 Sanborn Fire Insurance Map shows the structures in more detail, including important aspects of what the buildings were made of and some other characteristics of their appearance. Note the hydrant on the corner of Pine's store.

{{% fig "staten-island/1885-sanborn-p20" "800" /%}}

{{% fig "staten-island/1885-sanborn-p1" "500" /%}}

The structural notations in the Sanborn map confirms what can be seen in the following photo of the Pine residence, which also shows the side of Pine's "Gro. & Gen'l S.". The residence is a 2 1/2 story frame building with a shingled roof, and the store next to it is a 3 story brick structure, with windows on the alley wall on all three floors toward the front, with three more windows on the ground floor behind those. Also visible is the wood cornice on the storefront that is indicated in the Sanborn map, as well as the side of the shed in the rear of the store next to the stables.

{{% fig "staten-island/pine-residence" "800" /%}}

Although I don't have documentary evidence for this currently, I think it is reasonably likely that the Mills family lived at the Pine residence at some point, as other employees, proteges, and extended family lived with Charles Pine over the years.

The following are Google Maps street view images from Richmond Terrace captured in 2022 that show the buildings in the footprint of Pine's store and residence. "Apollo Intl." is in the area of Pine's residence, but the brick building to the left appears to be Pine's store intact, a fact confirmed further below.

It is also interesting to note that the Factory Lake (sometimes referred to as Factory Pond) raceway flows behind Pine's store, where stables are indicated. Factory Lake became quite polluted and was filled in by the early 1900's, and is the location today of Corporal Thompson park, named after the first African-American from Staten Island to be killed in action in the Vietnam War, in 1967.

It appears that by 1878, James Hillyer had left Pine's store and started a new store on Richmond Terrace with his brother-in-law [Barnett Egbert](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/118458051/barnett-egbert) (1837 to 1916), called Hillyer & Egbert. At some point, Charles' son joins his grocery business which is then called C. M. Pine & Son or, in some places, Charles M. Pine & Son.

James Hillyer appears to also be connected with William Snedeker, who married Charles' and Mary Ann's sister Lois Almy (Pine) Snedeker (1805? to 07 Nov 1890). William and Lois moved to Staten Island in the 1850's, and William was also in the dry goods business. William Snedeker and James A. Hillyer were also leaders within the congregation of the Trinity Methodist Episcopal Church, near James' home.

The 1870 US Census and the 1875 NY Census show William Snedeker's family living near James Hillyer's family, and near both the Methodist Church and C. M. Pine & Co.

(As is evident from these census entries, James A. Hillyer's wife Phoebe (22 Jul 1834 to 05 Feb 1914) had the middle name "Anna" and apparently had the nickname "Annie".)

A summary of the census data for William Snedeker during the relevant time period: 

<figure>

| Year | Location | Age | Occupation|
| --- | --- | --- | ---|
| 1850 | NY Ward 17 | 39 | hosiery |
| 1860 | Castleton  | 48 | merchant (son and neighbor, Livingston is "merchants clerk") |
| 1870 | Castleton  | 59 | dry goods merchant |
| 1875 | Castleton  | 60 | dry goods (son Livingston and wife are "boarders") |
| 1880 | Castleton  | 69 | boarder (living with son Livingston) |

</figure>

(At different times, Livingston was a reporter for the *Richmond County Advance* as well as a "slate dealer" among other careers.)  

Before he moved to Staten Island, the firm of Wm. Snedeker & Co. "dry goods jobbers" was located in the Manhattan financial district just a few blocks northeast of the future site of 1 World Trade Center and 2 World Trade Center, the "Twin Towers" that collapsed in the September 11 attacks of 2001. (Upon their completion, the Twin Towers were the tallest buildings in the world.)

<blockquote>
A dry-goods jobber is a wholesale buyer and seller, for cash or for approved credit, of all manner of goods, wares, and materials, large and small, coarse and fine, foreign and domestic, which pertain to the clothing, convenience, and garnishing, by night and by day, of men, women, and children: from a button to a blanket; from a calico to a carpet; from stockings to a bead-dress; from an inside handkerchief to a waterproof; from a piece of tape to a thousand bales of shirtings; not forgetting linen, silk, or woollen fabrics, for drapery or upholstery, for bed or table, including hundreds of items which time would fail me to recite. All these the dry-goods jobber provides for his customer, the retailer, who in his turn will dispense them to the consumer.

<blockquote>
A factory having produced a stock of goods from the best designs to be obtained by its agents here and abroad, the next step is to sell at a profit. Twenty-five years ago the mill or factory sold all its goods to the jobbers, who in turn distributed them to the retailers throughout the country. Each mill had its selling agents who undertook to dispose of its product to the jobbers. A retailer could buy nothing directly from the agent of the mill. Within the last ten or fifteen years the small jobber has been eliminated. In 1850 there were half a hundred dry-goods jobbers in New York City and as many in Boston all doing a good business. Today the number has dwindled to half a dozen in each city. The same thing is true of Philadelphia and Chicago. Only a few of the very largest jobbing houses have survived. The selling agents of the mills now go direct to the retailer, because the retailers have in many instances become buyers upon a much larger scale than the small jobber of former days. Go into the Boston or New York office of the agent of any important mill, and you will find plenty of samples and clerks, but almost no buyers. The agent now goes to the buyer. The agent of the largest cotton-mill in western Massachusetts told me that he sent his men to every large drygoods shop in Boston every day, and his partner in New York did the same thing there. At certain seasons Boston and New York, twenty-five or thirty years ago, were overrun with the buyers of dry-goods houses from all parts of the country. There were hotels and even newspapers devoted to these buyers and their doings. Much of this business has passed away. To-day the travelling men, “drummers,” of the mills and the few large jobbing houses that have survived, scour the country, taking their samples to the retailer. A few large jobbers, doing an immense business, still survive in all our large centres because they have the machinery for the distribution of goods in channels where it is not worth the while of the agent to enter—small shops in small towns. The small jobber who gave up business when he found the mills selling directly to the retail shops who could buy even more goods at a time than he could, had neither the capital nor the army of travelling men necessary to do business upon this scale. The jobber who could buy five thousand cases of goods at a time, and had the machinery and the means for disposing of it, survives because the mills sell cheapest to the largest buyer, and the jobber who buys on this scale is more important that even the largest retail store. But the small jobber, buying one hundred cases of the same goods, gets no better terms than the big retailer and has therefore no excuse for being. Some of the big department stores now obtain a monopoly of certain patterns or designs by taking the whole output of the mill, thus doing what was formerly in the power of only the greatest of jobbers.

Charles and his son Theodore also had significant business dealings beyond their store. According to data provided by the [Empire State Postal History Society](https://www.esphs.org/), Charles M. Pine was also postmaster of what was then called the North Shore, Staten Island post office from 16 Dec 1850 to 26 Oct 1853. This post office became the West New Brighton station of Staten Island on 21 Jan 1917.

Charles M. Pine was also one of the incorporators of The  Staten Island Savings Bank, which was organized on December  21, 1866, at Stapleton. His son Theodore Pine was a trustee of Richmond County Savings Bank. 

<figure class="quote-only">
<blockquote>
<p>The  Richmond  County  Savings  Bank  was  organized  on  October  30, 1886.  It  was  at  first  located  in  Odd  Fellows  Hall,  West  New  Brighton, until  1899  when  it  removed  to  its  own  building  on  Richmond  Terrace. From  that  it  moved  to  the  handsome  building  it  now  owns  and  occupies at  the  corner  of  Castleton  Avenue  and  Taylor  Street,  West  New  Brighton.  Its  first  officers  were  Monroe  Eckstein,  president;  John  Westbrook,  first  vice-president;  Jacob  I.  Housman,  second  vice-president; Robert  Moore,  cashier.  Trustees :  George  Bechtel,  Thomas  Humphrey, Stephen  D.  Simonson,  Richard  L’H.  Finch,  <strong>Charles  T.  Pine,</strong>  Charles W.  Hunt,  Charles  W.  Kennedy,  John  W.  Winmill,  Otto  Ahlmann,  Daniel  T.  Cornell,  Thomas  Byrne,  David  Soloman.  By  1900  John  Westbrook  had  become  president  and  the  following  had  joined  the  board, Henry  P.

In  1911  Mr.  Smith  was president  with  the  late  G.  H.  Tredwell  as  secretary.  Upon  Mr.  Tred- well’s  death,  Mr.  Matthius  became  secretary. </p>

Despite many decades of success in varied endeavors that were important in the growth of Staten Island, both Charles M. Pine and his son Theodore were financially ruined by the actions of Charles’ other son Alverade. Note the role that Mark Hartley played in the aftermath.

Left penniless, Charles M. Pine was forced to return to work, and to do so for the first time in many years as an employee in someone else' business. Elmira died just over a year later. Theodore, who had been blind for two years prior to the business failure, continued to decline, becoming "perfectly helpless" in his final years. Theodore died more than 2 years before Charles, and approximately six months prior to Charles' sister Mary Ann (Pine) Mills's death in Brookton.

The phrase "Theodore his legitimate son" may be understood in light of Alverade's scandal.
 
For more information about Theodore's time in the Civil War see [Milton Loper's Civil War Letters]({{% relref "staten-island/#milton-lopers-civil-war-letters" %}}), below, which also mention Charles and Elmira Pine and indirectly reference Pine's general store.

When Bartlett Brown Sr. completed his will on 23 October 1972, both of Charles M. Pine's sons, Theodore and Alverade were his witnesses, and after his death, Alverade notes that he was "well acquainted with Bartlett Brown" having known him "for many years before his death." Because Theodore died before Bartlett, fellow grocer Abram C. Hillyer, James A. Hillyer's brother, was also called upon to verify Theodore's signature, as Abram "was well acquainted with C. Theodore Pine, late of Castleton, Staten Island, and with his manner and style of writing, having often seen him write" (Wills, Vol 8-9, 1903-1906, Surrogate's Court, Richmond County NY, ancestry.com).

As I write this, the Richmond County Clerk makes deeds available online going back to the early 1900's, and I found Orville Pine's name among them.

Interestingly, in the 1910 United States Federal Census, James Hillyer and wife Phoebe are renting a home on Cary Avenue on Staten Island, and James lists his occupation as "furniture salesman", which is a bit inconsistent with his obituary below.

## Milton Loper's Civil War Letters

Martha Deed, the great-granddaughter of [Juliett (Loper) Shepard](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/36665791/juliet-shepard) (06 Jan 1845 to 02 Apr 1911), has done considerable work on her family history including transcribing many letters written to Juliett. The letters presented below were written by Juliett's cousin Milton Loper while he fought in the Union Army in the Civil War, and within, Milton mentions Theodore Pine and the Pine residence on Staten Island, providing insight into the Pine family residence at that time, just a few years after Edward Mills' family departed from Staten Island for Corfu. 

> "we have all three of us been exposed to immediate danger and have escaped. ought we not to be thankful to our heavenly Father. who alone hath preserved our lives?"
>
> "Rogers proposes to meet me somewhere in New York, and go home together. I have named Staten Island as a substitute — won't it be pleasant for us to meet there?" 
> 
> "...time drags heavily to me now. that I am looking forward so anxiously to a time when I can go home.  Why! Since the order came to muster us out, I have become almost homesick −  But I think I shall survive..."


In the following letter to Juliett, Milton specifically mentions Charles M. Pine and alludes to Pine, Hillyer & Co.: 

<figure>
<blockquote>

Camp of the 115th N.Y. Inft<br />
Near Petersburg Va<br />
Sept 21st 1864<br />

Cousin Juliett

There is one thing I forgot to mention in my last to you so for fear I may forget again, and the thought not return in season to be of any benefit I write this soon.  I am well aware too. that when you peruse this, you will think strange that I do not write to Uncle Charles instead of you.  My reply to this is. That I prefer writing to those I have reason to believe are at home rather than to those whome I know are absent.  I wrote to Uncle requesting him to order a pair of boots for me.  Very soon after. I concluded that a small hatchet − (one that I can carry in my waist belt.) would be very convenient, and intended to ask you to mention it to him. but forgot until now.  So I now wish you would be so kind as to say to Uncle. that I would like very much to have him send me such a hatchet. as I have described. Send it when he does the boots −I would like one that I can draw nails with and want it sharpened . for I can't find any thing here to sharpen my knife even.  Now that the business part of my letter is finished. I will devote the remainder of this sheet to something that may be more interesting.

#### References to Charles Theodore Pine and to Jarvis Rogers Loper in Luther Milton Loper's letters to Juliett Loper

**Compiled by Martha Deed**
**May 11, 2015**

Luther Milton Loper (1837-1865) had two close male relatives in the Civil War: Jarvis Rogers Loper (1835-1883) was his older brother, and Charles Theodore Pine (1839-1895) was his first cousin. He referred to them frequently in his letters to his first cousin, Juliett Loper. 

Note that members of the family were often called by their middle names. Thus, Luther (named after his paternal grandfather) was "Milton," Jarvis Rogers was “Rogers,” and Charles Theodore Pine (named after his father) was "Theodore." 

Milton, Rogers, Theodore and Juliett were all grandchildren of Luther Loper (1780-1856) and Sarah Bishop Loper (1786-1870). Jarvis Rogers and Luther Milton's father was their son, Isaac; Juliett's father was their son, Erastus; and Theodore's mother was their daughter, Elmira. 

Luther Milton Loper enlisted at Saratoga Springs, New York in August 1862, Charles Theodore Pine enlisted at Castleton, Staten Island, New York in August 1862, and Jarvis Rogers enlisted in the Rhode Island Volunteers (date unknown). 

Milton mentions Rogers and Theodore and the Pine family with some frequency in his letters to Juliett, including the following: 

You say Theodore was thinking about enlisting. So it seems we were both thinking of it at the Same time. and I for one decided to enlist. and did. on 6" August. left the state of N.Y. the 21‘. went to Harper's Ferry. .. Rogers is also in the Army. though not in the same Regmt that I am. . . 

Please write soon and let me know whether Theodore is in the Army. Your loving Cousin, Milton Oct 22/62 

Roger’s address is J. R. Loper, Co “I”, 2" R.I.V. Washington D C 

Dec 25/62 

Since I received your letter I have received one from Aunt Mary (Smith). She wrote that Theodore was with Banks Expedition, and that the boat he was in. grounded on the Florida Reefs, but he escaped unhurt. . Rogers was in the Battle at Fredricksburgh and he was unhurt. so you see we have great cause to be thankfull. we have all three of us been exposed to immediate danger and have escaped. ought we not to be thankful to our heavenly Father. who alone hath preserved our lives? 

Jan 7/63 

I have not yet received a letter from Auntie Pine [Charles Theodore Pine's mother]. I wish she would write. 

May 10/63 

I don't know what Rogers. could find to write about. in order to fill 9 pages. I guess he must keep a journal. 

Jul 13/63

I am obliged to you for sending Theodore's address. I think I shall write to him. . . How in the name of common sense, Rogers could think of enough to fill nine pages, I can't see. By the way, I received a letter from Helen, in which she stated that Rogers, wrote that his Regt was ordered to march on to Gettysburgh[sic]. I had not heard from him since. So of course did not know whether he survived to battle or not. She wrote that the papers state that his Regt lost in killed -45. I am quite anxious to hear from him 

Aug 2/63 

I have at last concluded to have my photograph taken, and this is the reason I write now so as to send one to you before they get damaged, for I have no convenient place for keeping them. I also inclose [sic] one for Auntie Pine. which you will please send to her. with my compliments. 

Aug 21/63 

I wrote to you last week and sent you two of my photographs, one for you, and the other for Auntie Pine, which I hope may reach their destination safely. Rogers is acting Brigade Hospital Steward, So he and Theodore are both in good and comfortable situations, better off than I am. . . 

Aug 28/63 

I sent two of my photographs in the letter, one of which I of course intended for you. the other was for Auntie Pine. I hope you will get yours all right. I did receive the letter in which you requested me to direct to Staten Island, but forgot to do so. I will try to direct this one right. 

Sep 15/63 

Note: Pine family lived on Staten Island. 

Rogers is in Virginia somewhere. The letter I received from him yesterday was mailed from Alexandria, but his address is, Washington. D. C. as before, or in other words, it is Mr. J. R. Loper. Co. 9 2 R.I. Vols., Washington, D. C. 

Oct 2/63 

I am glad to hear that Grand Ma's [Sarah Bishop Loper] health is better. than when you last wrote. and that Theodore is rising in the world. 

Nov 19/63 

Note: Reference may be to Theodore being promoted to 2nd Lt. and joining U.S. Colored Troops in October 1863. 

I suppose Theodore enjoyed himself more at that dinner party. than I would have done. could I have had the privalige [sic]. for I am not very social, which you perhaps well know. . . Rogers wrote that He. had just received a letter from Cousin Mary G[?]. Buffet. He said he dreaded to answer the letter, but could not very well get around it. 

Jan 7/64 

I would like to write to Theodore. but have forgotten his address. please give me it again. and I will copy is so that I can write whenever I have an opportunity. I wrote to him about the first december last but did not direct as you told me but guessed at his Address-- and now. I guess. that I didnt guess right. this was before you sent his address 

Feb 10/64

I found a letter there for me from Theodore, which surprised me somewhat. It was written the 2™ of April. He was well at the time. 

May 27/64 

Rogers is now Hospital Steward. And gets 30$ per month. And [illegible]. So he is above me now, and will be I suppose until I get a Commission. He has been more fortunate than I have, he went into an old Regt as a recruit so of course did not stand so good a right for a promotion as if he had enlisted with the Regt but he has worked his way to a very good and admirable position. I went into the service a Sergt and am only first Sergt yet. 

Jun 27/64 

I hope Theodore is well by this time. Patients in Hospital do not get the “best of care.” as one would conclude after reading the papers. 

Aug 16/64 

I received a letter from Roger to night. He is near Harper's Ferry and say they have to change their position quite often. 

Sep 19/64 

I think it will be as well for Theodore to remain at home now. that is. after he gets there. which I hope he will do soon. After one has been in the service two or three years. I think he has done his share. though if he is really anxious to do more I am willing he should. but shall not advise him to. 

Oct 14/64 

I received a letter from Brother Rog. the other day. It seems He conducted himself in such a manner. during Sheridan's operations in the "Valley" (in his capacity of Hospital Steward of course) as to fain the approbation of the Div Surgeon who subsequently was appointed Inspector (Judicial) and took Rogers with him in the office to do his writing, which Rog says he finds very easy and comfortable position. He is at Winchester, Va. and says he owes his position. to his attending to his "Biz" while in the field. 

Nov 6/64 

I recd.. one a few days later from Rogers written the same day. He was well and so well pleased with his situation. that he thinks of going into the regular service. If he was in my place. here at the front. obliged to get up at four and five oclock every morning and stand in line of battle until day light. besides being routed out and midnight about twice every week. He would not be so fast for continuing in the service. 

Nov 21/64 

Rogers proposes to meet me somewhere in New York, and go home together. I have named Staten Island as a substitute — won't it be pleasant for us to meet there? 

May 19/65 

Rogers has some peculiar notions about some things and it may not suit his convenience to meet me on S. I. [Staten Island] so I have written him that I will meet him wherever he directs. 

Jun 5/65

Milton Loper's Army photograph, presumably the same one he mentioned having taken in Aug 1863:

At least two known photographs of Theodore survive, including his Army portrait, donated to the New York Military Museum by Martha Deed:

Martha provided the following additional context to the photograph:

Martha has an additional portrait taken after the War that shows "Theodore Pine as a yong man":

{{% fig "staten-island/martha-deed/theodore" "800" /%}}

Based on similar characteristics of Theodore's two photographs, the second was taken perhaps only a few years after the Army portrait, possibly when Theodore was in his late 20's or early 30's.

> The head post was most popular in the early 1860’s, usually treated with a vignette look, with the area around the head feathered or gradually fading away. The image area in these head poses was quite small, due to camera and lens technology at that time. The camera was usually 12 or more feet from the subject, and the concept of telephoto or zoom did not exist.

> Nearly all pre-1863 cards have no border. Even though borders first appeared in 1862 (usually hand drawn) this style was not widely used until 1864. … The first commonly used borders usually consisted of two thin gilt lines of the same width. These have only been found on documented 1863 and 1864 cards. Beginning in 1864, nearly all documented cards, especially the vast number with tax stamps, have two gilt lines, but the outer line is considerably thicker that the inner line. This dual-width style of border remained almost unchanged until about 1869.

Milton mentions Theodore's hospital stay, and as already discussed above, it was not long after Milton wrote that "Theodore is rising in the world" due to his promotion to 2nd Lieutenant, that Theodore fell from his horse, injuring his spine, which also affected his eyesight. He would never fully recover from these injuries, which as stated in his obituary, "finally resulted in the total loss of his sight and in the brain trouble which for several years past left him perfectly helpless, and to which he at last succumbed." Comparing his Army portrait with the studio portrait taken perhaps just a few years later, his gaze does seem to have a different quality.

{{% fig "staten-island/martha-deed/theodore-portrait-comparison" "800" /%}}

Milton Loper's letters to Juliett as well as other family letters referencing Staten Island make it clear what the census records suggest: that in addition to boarders that commonly included employees of Pine, Hillyer & Co., the residence of Charles M. and Elmira Pine in West New Brighton was visited often by close and extended family members, and Juliett and Milton write about meeting at Staten Island with a mixture of warmth and excitement that is palpable. And the nieces and nephews seemed to regard Elmira with unique affection, as they always refer to her as "Auntie Pine", as compared to "Aunt Mary (Smith)" for example.

Contrasted with Rogers' eventual position as hospital steward, Milton describes long days battling on the front lines, at times ending in retreat. Fortunately, Milton survived the battlefield, and as his regiment was mustering out at the end of the war, he wrote his last two letters to Juliett "from the South" in which he expresses his longing to see her in Staten Island.

Raleigh N C May 19/65

Dear Cousin

Your long letter written sometime this month came to hand this morning. And to make amends for past neglect, I reply immediately.  If you did not get a letter from me after Feb 17th until that one I wrote after taking Raleigh, it was not my fault but the fault of the mail carriers for I wrote at least two and I think three letter in that time.  I wrote one while in camp near Wilmington from which place I also sent you a paper called the “Herald of the Union” printed in Wilmington which I suppose you did not receive as you never mentioned it.  I think I wrote again while near Goldsboro on or about the 22 March. and again while at Rockfish Creek. Bridge on the Wilmington and Weldon RR about 95 miles from the former place.  So you must not go back on me because you did not get them.  I am surprised that Uncle Manning should sell his beautiful place.  What do you sat to our making them another visit?

I am anxious to get home even if there is to be no more fighting.  For I want to see him. It will seem to be free once more.  It is rumored that we are to be mustered out before our term of service expires.  I hope so and then I flatter myself in having a few weeks recreation at Staten Island, New Brunswick, Hempstead and Saratoga and then I shall be homeward bound.  Rogers proposes to meet me somewhere in New York, and go home together.  I have named Staten Island as a substitute – won't it be pleasant for us to meet there?  I may make Uncle Samuel a visit but have not decided.  It is raining and I hope it will rain all day – cause why?  So I shall not have to drill.  I hate these drills and inspections now the war is over and the fewer of them I have to do with the better.

I am glad you were pleased with Burty.  I would like very much to have you go there with me if Auntie Pine can spare you when I return.  How would you like it?

I will close now so good bye

Yours as Ever<br />

  - "Uncle Samuel" *may* be a reference to Charles M. Pine's brother, [Samuel Mills Pine](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/180274612/samuel-mills-pine) (26 Nov 1814 to 14 Mar 1880), a carriage maker in Hempstead. Another possibility is Elmira's brother Samuel W. Loper, but at least at the time of his father Luther Loper's death, Samuel Loper was living in Newstead, Erie County NY.
  
  - I asked Martha if she thought "Burty" could be a reference to Albert Burt Pine, and her reply: "I wanted to caution you about "Burty" because there were great numbers of Alberts on both sides of my family in those days -- so it looked to me from other letters I have (totally unrelated to your side of the family--or maybe not) that the Burty of this letter was from the Hull family up in Connecticut, i.e. Charles's [Shepard] family, not Juliett's."

Raleigh N.C. June 5/65

My Dear Cousin

Yours of May 29th came this morning, and was read with pleasure, and this my answer, is in all probability my last letter to you from the South at least. until after I have again tasted the sweets of freedom. I long to be free, and in order to become so, I refuse to accept of a 1st Leutnt Commission, that is. to muster as such, for three years – My appointment is here – and the Commission will be soon.  I recd.. a copy of the N Y Times from you.  a few days ago and thank you for it.  I like to get reading matter for time drags heavily to me now. that I am looking forward so anxiously to a time when I can go home.  Why! Since the order came to muster us out, I have become almost homesick −  But I think I shall survive. so don't be alarmed.  I hope GrandMa will enjoy her visit to Hempstead, and also, that we shall enjoy ours.  Gertrude I understand has broken up house-keeping.  How that will affect our visit I do not Know. but I guess it will not interfere with it, though it may not be so pleasant to us, as though she were keeping house.  I know that I shall not enjoy myself so well and consequently shall not stay so long, but will try to enjoy the visit while I do stay.  Rogers has some peculiar notions about some things and it may not suit his convenience to meet me on S. I. [Staten Island] so I have written him that I will meet him wherever he directs.  I have had an invitation to visit Aunt Mary and Nancy Smith and Buffet and I think I will accept.  If I go to Josie you must go with me.  If you will that is of course.  I do not mean to dictate to you.  I have enough of that here in the army.  I shall be glad when I can get where I can get what I want from others, without saying you must do so etc etc and I shall be joyful beyond measure, when I can feel and know that no human being has the right to say to me You must do this, or you must do that – and the sooner that blessed time arrives the better.

There is to be a great exactment at Saratoga on the 4 Jul and Gen Grant is expected to be there.  I hope that we may be there to see the “elephant.”  Leut Geary has come and now we have to get to work at the muster out rolls again.

Yours as Ever <br /> 
L M Loper

PS  an officer just came from HeadQuarters with orders for us to suspend operations until next week – Then they will muster our Regt out – there is something wrong about the rolls – Well I suppose I must live in hope awhile longer. L.M.L.

> The plan was to meet at the Pine house in Staten Island for a family reunion.  Milton did not make it.  He was placed on a hospital ship and taken to Portsmouth Grove Civil War hospital just outside of Providence, RI and died there of typhoid fever July 4 or 5,1865.  He spent three years in the Union Army and never made it home.  He was buried on the hospital grounds, but his body was later moved to a Cypress Hills Civil War cemetery in Brooklyn -- as documented by a plaintive letter from his father, Isaac Loper, to Rhode Island officials in 1868. I visited Cypress Hills and took the attached photo.

> Odd note about that hospital:  I later learned that three distant cousins of mine served as nurses at that hospital.  I have a photo of one of them, Ada Brewster, taken while she worked there.  Ada Brewster was an artist and my very distant connection to her is on my father's side of the family, while the Lopers are on my mother's side.  The paternal relatives and the Brewsters were very close associates though not close genealogically, which is how I found the Brewsters.  I've wondered if Luther and the Brewster sisters ever met.

  - "Typhoid fever, also known as typhoid, is a disease caused by Salmonella serotype Typhi bacteria. Symptoms vary from mild to severe, and usually begin six to 30 days after exposure. Often there is a gradual onset of a high fever over several days. This is commonly accompanied by weakness, abdominal pain, constipation, headaches, and mild vomiting. Some people develop a skin rash with rose colored spots. In severe cases, people may experience confusion. ...Typhoid is spread by eating or drinking food or water contaminated with the feces of an infected person. Risk factors include limited access to clean drinking water and poor sanitation. Those who have not yet been exposed to it and ingest contaminated drinking water or food are most at risk for developing symptoms."

## Early 2000's Images of Pine, Hillyer & Co. Building

What is to my knowledge the only surviving photograph of the residence of Charles M. and Elmira Jane Pine in Staten Island shows the side of C. M. Pine & Co., the grocery and dry goods store that Charles M. Pine ran with his son Theodore. Before Theodore joined the business, it was known as Pine, Hillyer & Co. at the same location, in partnership with James A. Hillyer.

As I write this in late 2023, the Richmond County Clerks office in Staten Island does have digitized records searchable online, but only going back to the early-mid 1900's. Despite this, I think I can confidently show that the store building whose side is shown in the Pine residence photograph still exists in active use as I write this.

The most detailed maps I have seen of the properties of Staten Island of the 1800's are the Sanborn Fire Insurance maps, created a decade before the Pine residence photograph was taken, that shows the residence and "Gro. & Gen'l S."

{{% fig "staten-island/1885-sanborn-p20" "800" /%}}

{{% fig "staten-island/1885-sanborn-p1" "500" /%}}

The Sanborn map confirm what is captured in the Pine residence photograph. Pine's store is a 3 story red brick structure, with windows on the alley wall on all three floors toward the front, with three more windows on the ground floor behind those. Also visible is the wood cornice on the storefront that is indicated in the Sanborn map, as well as the side of the shed in the rear of the store next to the stables.

Finally, note that Pine's store is slightly trapezoidal, matching the curve of Richmond Terrace at that point. All of these are corroborated by contemporary Google Maps photographs taken from Sep 2007 to Oct 2022, at both street level and aerial views.

A similar shape is not present in the Beers maps from 1874, although these maps are much less detailed in general.

Matt Long is a recent former owner of the property and has confirmed that the building is indeed the same that housed Pine's store.

Closer images clearly testify to the age of the bricks and evidence of recent repair work can be seen in some images, where there is white patching. Notice too that the bricks encompassing the third story windows on the front face of the building appear to be a distinctly different color than the bricks around it, suggesting they were replaced at a later time.

Some of these closer images show clear details of the decorative window lintels (which I had erroneously called "cornices" in my message) that can be seen on all windows of all floors on the north (front) and east faces. Their excellent condition today is the result of Matt Long's work.

For nearly half a century up to that point, the building was occupied by Furniture Restoration Workshop.

## More on Bartlett Brown, Hawkins Ancestry and Descendants

The parents of [Bartlett Brown](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199802084/bartlett-brown) (1833 to 24 Nov 1902) are [Abraham "Abram" Brown](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/20577929/a-brow) (10 May 1802 to 10 Feb 1874) and [Hannah Hawkins](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/122608336/hannah-brown) (04 Feb 1804 to 14 Aug 1879). A "Hawkins family" folder and a folder containing Hawkins genealogical data are archived in the <a href="https://www.queenslibrary.org/manuscripts/0205#bg-largeview-about">The Mills Family of Jamaica and Mills Pond, Long Island</a>, Archives at Queens Library, Queens Borough Public Library, Jamaica NY. I have yet to personally examine these.

The early Hawkins genealogy, like the Mills genealogy, is explored in *Genealogies of Long Island Families*:

<figure>

> This family has always been a very prolific one in Suffolk County, particularly in Brookhaven Town where the common ancestor Zachariah Hawkins settled. Members of the family can now be found in almost every town in Suffolk County. The early generations generally spelled the name "Hawkings" but all finally adopted the correct spelling.
> 
> Zachariah Hawkins<sup>1</sup> an Englishman, was one of the original proprietors of Brookhaven Town, settling at Setauket in 1655. He was a large property owner and a prominent man in the settlement.

It was Robert Hawkins (1610 to 11 Sep 1704)–the father of Zachariah "Zachary" Hawkins (25 Oct 1639 to 1699) "the common ancestor" mentioned above—born in Plymouth, Devon, England, who immigrated to America in 1635, marrying Mary Marie Pease that same year in Charlestown, Suffolk, Massachusetts.

The most complete genealogical record of the ancestry of [Bartlett Brown](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199802084/bartlett-brown) (1833 to 24 Nov 1902), that I have yet reviewed, is by Gerald Molloy (@jerrymolloy) on [Geneanet.org](https://gw.geneanet.org/jerrymolloy?lang=en&n=brown&oc=0&p=bartlett), which I rely upon heavily below.

</figure>

I have often wondered if Bartlett Brown and Edward H. Mills were related, if even distantly. There are several instances of the descendants of Zackary Hawkins, and the descendants of Timothy Mills of Mills Pond intermarrying and both the Hawkins and Mills genealogies include multiple instances each of Hallock and Longbotham. I have only begun to explore all of the lines that could potentially intersect, and I don't know when or even if I will ever complete that work, as answering this question isn't my highest priority currently, and I suspect that gaps in genealogical records may make it impossible to draw a definite conclusion. I suspect that it is unlikely the two men were related, even distantly, but again, this is just my impression after gaining some initial familiarity with the Mills, Hallock and Hawkins genealogies.

Bartlett Brown married [Sarah Adelaide (Ward) Brown](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199802098/sarah-a-brown) (1833 to 04 Sep 1916) on 13 Sep 1860. Bartlett and Sarah's marriage as well as their children's baptisms are all recorded by the Reformed Dutch Church of Port Richmond. Their children are:

  - Adele Irving Brown (09 Nov 1862 to 18 Jan 1927). It appears that Adele never married or had children, and census records indicate that she lived for many years with her younger brother Bartie's family. Although some census records may suggest her middle initial was "J", the middle name "Irving" is explicitly written in her baptism records in the Reformed Dutch Church of Port Richmond, as well as the 1910 United States Federal Census.

  - Charles Pine Brown (25 Jan 1866 to 22 Jan 1887), named for his father's mentor and friend, Charles M. Pine. (This seems most likely, although perhaps he could also be named for Charles' son Charles Theodore Pine, who was a witness to Bartlett's will. But Theodore was in the same generation as Bartlett, and in fact, a few years younger, so it seems more logical that he named his son for his mentor in the grocery business.) Charles died of tuberculosis in West New Brighton just three days before his 21st birthday, and is purportedly buried in Moravian Cemetery. (1887, New York State Death Index, Certificate number 41287, New York Department of Health, Albany, NY, ancestry.com.) I find no evidence that Charles ever married or had children. 

  - [Bartlett "Bartie" Brown Jr.](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199802139/bartlett-brown) (04 Mar 1870 to 15 Dec 1946). Bartlett Sr. retired from the grocery business in 1892, and the 1900 census implies that Bartlett Jr. continued to run the store for some years after. By 1910, Bartlett Jr. is working in the railroad industry, and by 1920, he is "chief accountant" at a railroad company.

{{% fig "staten-island/1916-09-05-New-York-Herald-New-York-NY-p10" "500" /%}}

Bartlett Brown Jr. Married [Elizabeth "Bessie" F. (?) Brown](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199802102/elizabeth-brown) (1871 to 13 Nov 1946) and they lived for many years at 302 Bement Avenue in West New Brighton. Note that Bartie outlived Bessie by just a month. Their children:

  - Farrington Wade Brown (01 Dec 1894 to 27 Sep 1963) served in World War I, and graduated from Columbia University with a degree in architecture, which he made his career. His physical description, recorded on his military recruitment card, describes him as tall and slender, with brown hair and brown eyes. Farrington married Mabel Cornell Barton on 21 Jan 1926 in Manhattan, and they had a son, Barton Brown, born Jun 1935.

  - Amy Bartlett Brown (? to ?).

## Churches in Staten Island
 
The families of Edward Mills, Charles Pine (including his siblings and their descendants, such as Livingston Snedeker) and Bartlett Brown, along with several Hillyers, including [Abraham Crocheron Hillyer](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/9143966/abram-crocheron-hillyer) (25 Dec 1842 to 14 Oct 1932) of Hillyer & Hartley, and [Alice E. (Hillyer) Egbert](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/118458007/alice-e-egbert) (1841 to 1915), are all members of the Reformed Dutch Church of Port Richmond. Alice is James Hillyer's sister, and she married his business partner, Barnett Egbert—sometimes spelled “Barnet”–also a member of the Church. (Barnett Egbert's father Barnett Egbert Sr. was a Church elder.) Other familiar family names associated with the church include the Bedell's and Mersereau's.

The Crocheron family have been prominent in the county ; Henry was Member of Congress 1815—'17. Jacob was Member of Congress 1829—'31 ; Presidential elector in 1836; Sheriff 1802, 1811 and 1821. Nicholas was Member of Assembly, 1854. Richard was County Treasurer, and Surrogate, 1836, and for several years thereafter. The family is of French descent.

In the *Records of the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church on Staten Island*, there are the following entries for members with the family name of Mills, that as far as I can tell, are unrelated to Edward Mills:

  - 02 Mar 1850, Jacob H. Van Pelt marries Melinda Mills in Staten Island.
  - 08 July 1864, John B. Martling marries Helen Louisa Mills.
  
The Vanderbilt family is the most famous of the Reformed Church's past congregants.

<blockquote>
KILL VAN KULL—ARTHUR KULL.

The precise meaning of the Dutch word "Cull," we are unable to give, though it probably had some reference to the water, as Newark Bay was emphatically called "the Cull," and was universally known by that name. The Dutch word "Kill" meant a small stream or passage of water; therefore, the name Kill Van Kull means the stream or passage from the Cull, or Kull, as it is now spelled. Arthur Kull, or Kill, as it is now sometimes written, is a corruption of the Dutch word "achter," after, or behind; therefore, Achter Kull meant behind or beyond the Cull. An attempt has recently been made to change the orthography of the word Van, by substituting the letter O for A, thus, Von, which is neither Dutch nor English, and arises from ignorance of the fact that the Dutch A in this connection has the sound of the English O in the same connection; therefore, to spell the word correctly, it should be written Van, and pronounced Von. We give the above as the explanation of the origin of the Dutch names of these waters. </blockquote>

Finally, here is some basic information on the Presbyterian churches on Staten Island. Although Calvary Church was organized well after the Mills had left Staten Island, it is interesting to note that it was originally comprised of many members of the Reformed Dutch Church. The Methodist Episcopal Church was attended by Mary Ann's sister and James A. Hillyer.

I have looked through transcriptions of the Reformed Church's graveyard and could not find an entry for James Wheelock Mills. Kathleen Langdon from the Reformed Dutch Church performed an independent search and also could not find him. Finally, I have also examined the First of Staten Island/Stapleton records on Ancestry.com, and I did not find him there.
