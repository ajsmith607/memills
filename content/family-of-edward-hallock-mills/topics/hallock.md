Edward Hallock Mills (25 Mar 1819 to 01 Jan 1908) was distantly related to [William B. Hallock](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/66471939/william-b-hallock) (07 Jul 1822 to 29 Mar 1901), a prominent farmer in Caroline, and later Danby, who is closely associated with Thomas H. Howell, of Howell Brothers general store, also in Danby. Eventually, Hallock and Howell partnered on a dry goods store in Willseyville. Edward and William share the ancestor William Hallock (1610? to 1684), who was the only son of Peter Hallock, “The Original” Hallock in America.

According to the Mills genealogy, Edward's mother Mary Hallock is the daughter of Thomas Hallock.

Yet neither Mary Hallock, nor the similarly identified Sarah Hallock, are listed in the volume *A Hallock genealogy: an attempt to tabulate and set in order the numerous descendants of Peter Hallock, who landed at Southold, Long Island, New York about the year 1640 and settled at Aquebogue, near Mattituck* by Lucius Henry Hallock, 1928, familysearch.org. 

However, when looking into the Hallock genealogy, one is immediately struck by the lack of wives and daughters listed in earlier generations. Lucius Hallock acknowledges this:  

{{% fig "hallock/hallock-genealogy-tabulation-p16" "800" /%}}

But I believe I have compelling circumstantial evidence that demonstrates that Mary and  Sarah Hallock are sisters who married the Mills brothers. 

There are exactly two dozen Thomas Hallocks in *A Hallock Genealogy*, however, I believe Mary Hallock's father can be confidently identified among them and her place in the genealogy can be restored. Beginning with the complete inventory of Thomas Hallocks across all generations as given in *A Hallock Genealogy*, summarized below:

Of these Thomas Hallocks, only two are known to be living in Smithtown during the correct time period, and they are in the same generation:
    
  - [Thomas Hallock](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/36331658/thomas-hallock) (06 Jan 1766 to 10 Mar 1845), son of Noah and Nancy (Hendrickson) Hallock. He also had a son Thomas who was a farmer in Smithtown. 

  - [Thomas Hallock](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/240646827/thomas-hallock) (11 Jul 1768 to 07 Jan 1854), son of James and Mary (Post) Hallock.

It is Thomas, son of Noah, who is found in the early records of the First Presbyterian Church in Smithtown in the late 1700's and early 1800's. He, along with Mary Platt's father Jedediah Mills, were among the members that "revolted" in Oct 1808. Although he also has daughters named Sarah and Mary, the birthdates and married names do not match what we know of either Sarah or Mary Hallock, who are the daughters of Thomas who married the Mills.

{{% fig "long-island/1759-1808-smithtown-presb-p15" "800" /%}}

So, by process of elimination among the known Thomas Hallocks, [Thomas Hallock](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/240646827/thomas-hallock) (11 Jul 1768 to 07 Jan 1854), son of [James Hallock](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/240647109/james-hallock) (1731 to 27 Sep 1775) and [Mary (Post) Hallock](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/240647149/mary-hallock) (1734 to 31 May 1810), is the only possible father of both Sarah and Mary Hallock, sisters who married the Mills brothers George and Jonas. 

{{% fig "hallock/hallock-genealogy-tabulation-p601" "800" /%}}

This Thomas Hallock did not officially join First Presbyterian Church of Smithtown until 06 July 1828.

{{% fig "long-island/1800-1860-smithtown-presb-p9" "800" /%}}

However, several entries for this Thomas Hallock, son of James, in the LongIslandSurnames.com database show his marriage to Sarah (25 Nov 1780 to 18 Jan 1847) occurred 08 Mar 1797 in Smithtown Long Island NY, confirming that Mary Hallock was indeed a "Smithtown woman" when she married Jonas, as stated in her son James' obituary. (23 Apr 1915, The Long-Islander, Huntington NY, p5, nyhistoricnewspapers.org.) This Thomas Hallock is the father of Sarah A[nn], and also of James born 04 Aug 1800, corroborating the Hallock genealogy:

>  1. James Hallock,   b. 4 Aug 1800, Smithtown, Suffolk Co., LI, NY  d. 4 May 1882, Smithtown, Suffolk Co., LI, NY (Age 81 years)  [natural]
>
>  2. Alma Hallock,   b. 3 Jul 1804, Smithtown, Suffolk Co., LI, NY  d. 26 Jul 1877, Smithtown, Suffolk Co., LI, NY (Age 73 years)  [natural]
>    
>  3. Sarah A Hallock,   b. 29 Aug 1812, Smithtown, Suffolk Co., LI, NY,  d. 22 Apr 1897, Patchogue, Suffolk Co., LI, NY (Age 84 years)  [natural]

Therefore, I conclude that this Thomas Hallock must be Edward H. Mills' grandfather.

The history and genealogy of the Hallock family in America has been painstakingly researched and documented over multiple generations of Hallocks, starting with [Reverend William Allen Hallock](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/146144870/william-allen-hallock) (02 Jun 1794 to 02 Oct 1880), a Congregational pastor whose 1866 work *Hallcok Ancestry* was extended in 1906 by his nephew [Charles Hallock, M. A.](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/136091127/charles-hallock) (1834 to 1917) (for whom the city of Hallock MN is named) , finally culminating in the 1928 *Hallock Genealogy* by [Lucius Henry Hallock](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/86053988/lucius-henry-hallock) (1853 to 01 Dec 1933). 

{{% fig "hallock/hallock-genealogy-tabulation-p15b" "800" /%}}

The Hallock name was brought to America by Peter Hallock "The Original", who was a pilgrim fleeing religious persecution. The Hallock name began branching in the third generation, with the Four Sons of William, the only son of Peter The Original. Like the Mills, the Hallocks reused the same names over and over, especially those of the Four Sons of William. The name "Edward" also appears often in the Hallock genealogy.

The Hallock family name spread quickly throughout New York State, including Staten Island, Central and Western New York, and even Caroline in Tompkins county, and continued across the country.

William B. Hallock owned various properties in the town of Caroline at a time when the Mills were living in Corfu, for example:

Edward H. Mills and William B. Hallock are both in the eighth generation of the Hallock family, although their respective branches diverge immediately from their origin, so the relationship is quite distant.

William B. was under the "John Branch" of the Hallock tree, said to be the most prolific of the Four Sons of William, and as Lucius Hallock noted "the ten daughters of the first John have been most difficult to place". John converted to Quakerism, to the great dismay of his father.

William Hallock’s family moved from Caroline to Danby sometime between 30 Jun 1865, when they are listed in the New York State Census in Caroline (Ancestry.com) and 02 Jul 1870, when they are listed in the United States Federal Census in Danby (Ancestry.com), at least a decade before Edward Mills’ family moves to Caroline. 

What follows is a sampling of some of the more interesting news items related to William Hallock.

It is perhaps worth pointing out again, what has already been stated above: that Howell is the surname of Peter The Original's second wife–who was also previously married–as well as the maiden name of the wife of Peter’s only son William. 

<figure>

> Peter Hallock was accompanied later by his second wife, known as the Widow Howell. She had a son and a daughter by a former husband and he also had a son by a former wife. He promised her that if she would accompany him to this new world, her son should share equally with his in his estate.
>…
> Peter Hallock had one son, William, who married Margaret Howell, daughter of the widow Howell, before she became the wife of Peter. As his mother was a former wife of Peter, they were not related.
>
> The widow’s son, Richard, also married a daughter of William, thus effectually uniting the Hallocks and the Howells.

So, while there is a good probability that the William Hallock and Edward Mills were at least aware of each other, living in nearby communities and in the same general line of work, I also suspect that because the Hallock family relationship was so distant, it may have been unknown to them, and therefore would seem to be an unlikely to be a factor in the Mills' decision to move to Mott's Corners. 

(But the question remains, why did Edward choose to move to Mott's Corners? How did he become aware of the opportunity to take over George Sander's store?)

[William B. Hallock](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/66471939/william-b-hallock) (07 Jul 1822 to 29 Mar 1901) married [Sarah (Fleming) Hallock](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/66472059/sarah-hallock) (08 Dec 1829 to 19 Oct 1910). 

Among William and Sarah's children, two died very young and are buried in Central Chapel Cemetery in Brooktondale: [Arthur Hallock](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/66484016/arthur-hallock) (01 Jan 1859 to 09 Oct 1865) and [Sarah Hallock](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/66483928/sarah-hallock) (23 Feb 1857 to 23 Oct 1865). Another son, [James Henry Hallock](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/97675935/james-henry-hallock) (1852 to 02 Sep 1924) is buried in Garret Mandeville Cemetery, along with his son, [Ezra Ward "Ward" Hallock](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/97714885/ezra-ward-hallock) (22 Mar 1896 to 1962).

William came from Orange County NY. Two of William's siblings lived nearby: [John Hallock](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/59251371/john-hallock) (27 Dec 1824 to 25 Mar 1884) whose descendants remained near Spencer, and [Almira L. (Hallock) Martin](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/145482231/almira-l-martin) (07 Mar 1807 to 16 Oct 1865) of Dryden.

And just as the family of Edward Mills' can trace their lineage to Mills' Pond, their Hallock ancestors also lived in a large area known as Hallockville that included a pond named for them.

<figure>

> In the late 20th century, the approximately 520 acres in the northeast corner of Riverhead Town and a small portion of adjacent Southold Town came to be known as the “KeySpan Property.” It included about 300 acres of farmland, 200 acres of woodland (mostly old fields and second-growth forest) and over 5,000 feet of shorefront on Long Island Sound, backed by high bluffs of sand and clay. Some parts of this area were highly disturbed by recent activities, but it also included the pristine Hallock Pond and large areas of wooded and semi-wooded wildlife habitat. In the first decade of the 21st century, this became the site of a remarkable preservation story that created Hallock State Park Preserve and permanently prevented development on the adjacent farmland. The area referred to in the 19th century as “Hallockville” because of the presence of so many Hallock families is approximately the same as the 20th century “KeySpan” property.

> But, the story really starts four generations earlier, shortly after the 1661 first Aquebogue Division when William Hallock ( -1684) moved to his new land in the wilderness and built the first home in the area, on what is now Hallock Lane. William’s oldest son Thomas lived there, followed by Thomas’s oldest son, Zerubabel, 1st (1696-1761), followed by his oldest son, Zerubabel, 2nd (1722-1800). All apparently lived on Hallock Lane and are buried in the Mattituck cemetery. Indeed second Zerubabel‘s grave in the northwest corner of that cemetery is one of the most spectacular examples of early gravestone carving in the area.
>
> The Zerubabel’s went on for another three generations, and their descendants continued to live on Hallock Lane until the mid-20th century – nine generations in all. But, the story of the immediate neighborhood of the Hallockville museum – shall we call it “Hallockville proper – really begins with Capt. Zachariah. He was the fourth son in a family of six sons and three daughters. Most likely, he needed to move out from the old homestead to find a place of his own.

As already noted above, Zerubabel Hallock (1696 to 1761, generation 4), the oldest son of Thomas (generation 3) who was the oldest son of William (generation 2), is Edward H. Mills' great-great grandfather.

## Alternate Spellings of Hallock

Edward H. Mills' middle name "Hallock" is spelled "Hallioch" in his obituary in the records of Caroline Valley Community Church.

{{% fig "mills-edward-mary-cvcc-obit" "800" "img,blockquote,cite,link" /%}}

Records of the Mattituck Presbyterian Church, which Edward's grandfather Thomas attended as a young man prior to his marriage, contain multiple spellings of "Hallock" including "Halloc", "Halock", "Haliock", "Halliock", and even "Hallaock". Records of the Smithtown Presbyterian Church, where several members of the Hallock family are listed as members, including Edward's grandparents later in life, also contain spelling variations,  including both "Hallock" and "Halliock". Spelling variations exist even within the Hallock genealogy itself.

<figure>
<blockquote>
Spelling was flexible back in the day. There were lots of variants on the Hallock name, and sometimes different descendants used different spellings.

The Hallock name is believed to be derived from the English "Holyoke", and Peter The Original may have changed it to "Hallock" to "facilitate his departure" from England. It is then reasoned that all other spellings among the descendants in America are "diatonics of Holyoke". These variations are so common even within the family, that it has led to questions about the very existence of Peter The Original, which is not helped by the fact that his and his only son William's burial locations are unknown.
