Before calling Mott's Corners home, the Mills moved to Corfu NY in the early 1860's where Edward, along with partners Charles Pine and James Hillyer, started E. H. Mills & Co. "cash store" offering general merchandise and dry goods. Horace clerked in his fatherâ€™s store, and Mary Ann was a member of First Presbyterian Church of Corfu.

The Mills, including Emily at just over one year old, are included in the 19 June 1860 Federal Census in Staten Island:

Documentation suggests the Mills family moved from Staten Island to Corfu sometime between 01 Sept 1862 and 01 May 1863, dates that correspond with tax assessment records of the time:

<div class="cols">

</div>
{{% fig "tax-assessments/1865-05-01-District-29-Division-12" "800" /%}}
</div>

The tax assessments are divided by "districts" then further subdivided into "divisions" at which point, individuals and businesses are listed together alphabetically. Beginning with entries recorded 01 May 1863, for district 29, division 12, and each year thereafter, there are two entries for E. H. Mills & Co. and Edward H. Mills. The 1862 document shown, recorded on 01 Sep 1862, has no such entries where they would be expected, strongly suggesting the family had not yet arrived in the area. Of course, these are just record dates, but they do give us a better defined window for when the family moved. This time period overlaps Emily's fourth birthday as well as the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation, five days after the Battle of Antietam, the Confederate invasion of Maryland that took place just 200 miles from Castleton. However, even if the above interpretation of these documents is correct, it could still very well be that the family moved as early as the Summer of 1862. 

As can be seen in the 1863 tax assessment documents, the Mills' store is entered as "Mills E. H. & Co.", showing that it was already operating by 01 May 1863, and I suspect that it was always in the Kinne building, although I don't know that for a fact. In the following property timeline provided by Allan Starkweather, Corfu Village Historian, I suspect that the 1866 date may have been derived from the 1866 Porter Store advertisement shown elsewhere. I can find no evidence in the Genesee County Clerk's Office deed indexes that Edward ever owned the store property.

Most of what I've learned about the Mills' time in Corfu is the result of prior research over a period of many years by Alan Starkweather, Corfu Village Historian, which he has generously shared and allowed me to republish here. Alan painstakingly documented Corfu over many years including research specifically on the Mills family.

There is also a June 1863 Civil War Draft Registration record in Genesee County for Edward where his occupation was listed as "merchant":

In Mar 1864, the Mills purchased their home in Corfu at what is presently 31 West Main Street:

It would appear that "James M. Hillyer" is an error as the James Hillyer that is closely associated with Charles Pine in the Staten Island grocery business was James **A.** Hillyer. 

From the documents available to me, that include city directories and census data, I see no evidence that James Hillyer or Charles Pine ever lived in Corfu, and instead multiple sources in the 1860's and 1870's tie them only to Castleton, and I get the sense that they were probably more in the role of investors and possibly advisers and likely not involved in the day-to-day operations of the store.  For more information on Charles Pine and James Hillyer, see [The Mills Family in Staten Island]({{% relref "staten-island" %}}).

The following map images and associated business directories, many provided by Alan Starkweather, show both the E. H. Mills & Co. general store as well as the Mills' home in Corfu in the same locations in 1866 and 1876. E. H. Mills & Co. was also referred to, on these maps and directories at least, as "Mills Cash Store" or just simply "Cash Store."

I searched the database of historical postmasters maintained by the United States Postal Service at USPS.com and cannot find an listing of Edward Mills as postmaster in Corfu at any time, or in any nearby postoffice in Genesee County, although other Corfu general store owners were among the postmasters listed, including George A. Porter (appointment 05 Jun 1857 to 04 Aug 1861) and Royal A. Kinne (appointment 15 Jul 1905 to 23 Mar 1914). 

As it would later be in Motts Corners/Brookton, theft was a fact of life for Edward:

There are records of a number of "lodges" of the Independent Order of Good Templars in the Batavia area. There was at least briefly a Corfu lodge of the Good Templars, although I don't yet know if Emily was a member there. This lodge apparently disbanded prior to 1885.

Mary Ann was known to be a member of the Presbyterian Church of Corfu, as were the MacGregors, the Mills' neighbors and friends:

By 1876, Corfu had grown considerably, but E. H. Mills & Co. and the Mills' home were still in the same locations:

In 1876, Horace shot himself, presumably in the Mills' home in Corfu:

According to Edward and Mary Ann's obituaries in the records of Caroline Valley Community Church, the Mills moved to Mott's Corners in Mar 1879. 

{{% fig "mills-edward-mary-cvcc-obit" "800" /%}}

Church records also include confirmation that Mary Ann had been a member of First Presbyterian Church of Cofu:

The following advertisements *may* be for the Mills' store, as both the description and timing fit, or this may possibly be for the Porter Store. According to the information provided by Allan Starkweather, Henry Porter, who owned the larger general store on the opposite corner of E. H. Mills & Co., retired in 1879, and F. H. Edwards started a hardware store at 3 East Main Street in 1879.

The Mills' home in Corfu sold later that year.

Emily returned to Corfu several times throughout her life.

Every member of Edward's family, except for Emily and James, is buried in Corfu.

{{% fig "evergreen-hill-cemetery-51" "800" /%}}

When Emily returned to Corfu with Edward's remains, both the building that housed E. H. Mills & Co., as well as the home she grew up in, were gone. 

A fire in 1899 destroyed the building that had once housed E. H. Mills & Co.

Finally, Allan Starkweather confirms the Mills' home in Corfu no longer exists at the time this is written. Real estate listings indicate the present structure was erected in 1900. 

## The MacGregors

When Edward and Emily returned to Corfu with Mary Ann's remains, they spent the evening at the home of the MacGregors. The MacGregors arrived in Corfu just a few years after the Mills family, and the maps above indicate that the MacGregors lived across the street from the Mills' home in Corfu. The MacGregors also attended the Presbyterian Church that Mary Ann attended.

## Churches in Corfu 

Although Mary Ann was a member of the Presbyterian Church in Corfu, the interconnections with the Congregationalists are interesting nonetheless:

The Congregationalist Church was active in Corfu from 1810-1830s. It never had its own building. It spent a few years as part of the Presbyterian Church,  then ceased to exist.

  <h4>Congregationalist Church</h4>

  <p>The Rev. John Spencer established a Congregationalist Church at Long's Corners [Corfu] in 1810. It was the first religious society in the Pembroke area. A permanent building was never built, they would occasionally meet at various homes. The Rev. Spencer had trouble finding people who were interested in religion. It was said that, "religion had not gone west of the Genesee River."
  </p>
  <p>
  When the Presbyterian Church was founded in 1817 the Congregationalists combined with them. By the 1840s most of them were gone.

  <h4>Presbyterian Church</h4>

  <p>The Rev. Hugh Wallis Founded the Presbyterian Church at Long's Corners [Corfu] in 1817. The constitution for the "First Presbyterian Society in Pembroke" drawn up in 1818. They build a building at 63 Allegany in 1831. And it is still in use today.
  </p>
  
  <p>There was a lot of dissention in the church by 1831. Two factions of Presbyterians and the Congregationalists were doing a lot of bickering. The Genesee Presbytery recommended that the church be dissolved. Later in 1831, the church was disbanded and the "Presbyterian Church of N. Pembroke" was formed. Most of the records of the first church were destroyed. In 1834, it was renamed the "Corfu United Presbyterian Church." The Congregationalist's never did reform.

<h4>Corfu United Presbyterian Church</h4>

<p>In 1817, the Rev. Hugh Wallis, a missionary under the Holland Land Company, found a religious society already established in the Pembroke township. He gathered together some more people and formed a congregation under the authority of the Presbyterian Church. As was the custom with Land Companies, four acres was granted for an established congregation to build a house of worship. The church sold the land in "London," now the Lover's Lane Road area) for $400 and used it towards the construction of a building at Longs Corners. The present sanctuary in Corfu was begun in 1829 and had a seating capacity of 100 persons. Over a split in doctrine the church dissolved. The new church immediately arising was called the Presbyterian Church in North Pembroke. Because of the rough times during the Civil War not much is known of the church history between 1834-1870. Like most churches of the time it barely kept its head above water while the women supported the meeting house in the absence of men. They oftentimes went into debt-an elder holding a note for the church. He was repaid in time and gave the interest free. The largest debt contracted was $25 for the repair of pew cushions. It took the ladies five years to repay the note held by Elder Whittlesey. After the war a large revival was held. That and a large movement to the mid- west changed the church rolls drastically. In 1887 there was a large scale move towards discipline and inactive members were excommunicated. Several cases were tried before session. About this time session indicated the evils of Sunday newspapers to the congregation.</p>

<p>In 1910 the Methodist and Universalist Churches disbanded strengthening the Presbyterian congregation. The turn of the century was a time of prosperity. In 1903 Cyrus Carrier became clerk of the session. In 1953 he was honored for over 50 years of well-kept books. In 1928 Rev. William Easton was called to pastor the church. He held the distinction of the longest pastorate in the church's history â€” 15 years. Before that pastors continued their relationship with the church for an average of 3 or 4 years. Rev. Paul Hagen came as a supply minister in 1943 and was asked to' stay in 1944. In 1947 Dr. Bergen accepted the call to the ministry, at that time the attendance was 240 members. In 1955, when his ministry was ended with his death the membership was 240. Rev. Sheldon Dodds supplied and in 1957 Rev. George Fritting was called as pastor. He was followed by Rev. James Bower in 1963 and Rev. Richard Murdoch in 1967.Rev. Charles Alexander has served since 2003.</p>

<p>I do not have any records from the church on hand, prior to the early 1900s.  Our church started in 1814, which means she would have been involved in our church at the very early years of our church opening as Pembroke Society.

<p>I did send out a message to see if there are still any records from the start of the church, but truth be told, back then, record keeping wasn't exactly a big thing. and if anything was still available, it would have been transferred over, and over again.
