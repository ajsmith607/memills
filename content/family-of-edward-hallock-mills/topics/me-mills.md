After moving to Mott's Corners in Mar 1879, Edward restarted his general store next to the Shurter House, where his surviving children Jonas and Emily clerked. Emily took over the store after Edward's death and operated it under the name M. E. Mills from 1909 until her death in 1937. Soon thereafter, Jessie Brewer took over the store and ran it under her name for a dozen years, primarily as a notions store with a lending library in the back. In 1961, Charles Vorhis purchased the building and moved the post office there from what is presently known as Brookton's Market. The Mills' store structure survives today and is located at 484 Brooktondale Road, better known to current residents as "The Old Post Office".

In the 1866 Photographic Atlas of Tompkins County by Stone & Stewart, a map of Mott's Corners shows a structure labeled "J. Shurter Store" in the same approximate location as Mills' Store.

[Josiah Shurter](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100594864/josiah-shurter) (26 Apr 1815 to 05 Aug 1877) married [Jane (Shutt) Shurter](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100594934/jane-shurter) (21 Nov 1825 to 23 Jun 1897). The land that starts just west of the lower bridge in Brooktondale and encompasses the area between the southern side of Brooktondale Road and Six Mile Creek, extending many acres westward, is referenced in the deed records of the Tompkins County Clerk as the Josiah Shurter Homestead. 

(Josiah and Jane Shurter were active in the local temperance movement. For more information on this, see {{% pagelink "good-templars" %}}.)

Although Josiah is not listed in the directory below the Stone & Stewart map, the first entry, "E. C. Marsh...Grocery and Provision Store" is almost certainly a reference to the J. Shurter Store. [Edward C. Marsh](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/28741041/edward-c-marsh) (23 Nov 1836 to 25 Jun 1907) is Josiah Shurter's son-in-law, and presumably Josiah's employee. As indicated in the 1865 New York State Census for Caroline, Edward and his wife Harriet (Shurter) Marsh were living in the home of Josiah Shurter. Both Josiah and Edward Marsh are identified as millers, as the Shurter family also owned the lower grist mill at that time. (See Caroline Deeds Book 1, p516, Willis Shurter and Jane his wife to Jacob Vandemark for $5000. The deed is dated 16 Dec 1867, but is recorded 22 Dec 1868.) 

{{% fig "me-mills/1865-06-26-NYS-census-caroline-p34" "800" /%}}

(It is Edward C. Marsh who appears to have carved his name into the {{% pagelink "property-features#the-stone-foundation" "foundation" %}} of Mills' Home at 475 Brooktondale Road.)

By the late 1860’s, Josiah Shurter’s properties were taken over by his son, [Willis Shurter](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/162159964/willis_shurter) (1840 to 17 Jan 1914). On 16 May 1868, "Willis Shurter and Jane Shurter his wife" sell the store property to [George E. Sanders](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338797/george-e-sanders) (16 Aug 1847 to 01 Nov 1889), and two years later in the 1870 United States Federal Census for Caroline, George E. Sanders is listed in the census as "clerk in store" while George's father, [George Townley Sanders](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338795/george-townley-sanders) (14 Nov 1818 to 04 May 1887) is listed as a "dealer in dry goods & groceries (ret)", in his son's building.

George T. Sanders married [Lurana Maria “Maria” (Nicholas) Sanders](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338796/lurana_maria_sanders) (30 Oct 1820 to 13 Jan 1884), and they, along with daughter and son-in-law, Amanda (Sanders) and Edward Lounsbery, were founding members of the [Congregational Church of Mott's Corners]({{% relref "founding-documents" %}}) in 1868. Interestingly, George T. Sanders was Brookton postmaster from 20 Jul 1861 to 15 Dec 1864, succeeded by Walker V. Personius. The postoffice was always closely associated with one of the general stores, which was a common custom in America at the time, especially in smaller communities. George T.'s tenure as postmaster could suggest that he worked in and possibly managed the store before his son purchased the building, just as he did for several years after his son sold it, but it could also suggest the possibility that George T. Sanders previously worked at Walker V. Personius' store, also known as "Mott's original store" at present day 559 Brooktondale Road.

On 12 Oct 1874, "George E. Sanders and Fannie his wife" ([Frances "Fannie" (Webster) Sanders](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338798/fannie-sanders) (23 Nov 1847 to 10 Feb 1896)) sell the store property to George's brother-in-law, [Edward Lounsbery](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338793/edward-lounsbery) (11 Oct 1833 to 27 Nov 1904), and a few months later in the 1875 census, George E. Sanders' occupation is "tanner" presumably working with Edward: when [Franklin Cuthbert Cornell Sr.](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/172201621/franklin-cuthbert-cornell) (28 Aug 1837 to 22 Jan 1908), the eldest son of [Ezra Cornell](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/233/ezra_cornell) (11 Jan 1807 to 09 Dec 1874), the founder of Cornell University, sold the upper grist mill property to George Campbell, Caroline Deeds book 3, page 550, 21 May 1881, a "piece of land" was reserved for Edward and his brother-in-law, [George E. Sanders](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338797/george_e_sanders) (16 Aug 1847 to 01 Nov 1889), which seems to corroborate a Carl English painting displayed in the Caroline History Room that refers to a tannery near the upper mill, although the deeds only refer to it as a "factory". George E.'s obituary states that he was also a produce dealer at one time.

It appears George E.'s father George T. Sanders continues to operate the store for several years the transfer from his son to his son-in-law, as evidenced by the following news item discussing the temperance group {{% pagelink "good-templars" %}}, of which George T. Sanders' family, including daughter [Amanda (Sanders) Lounsbery](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338794/amanda-lounsbery) (12 Oct 1842 to 13 Nov 1921) and her husband Edward, were members.

A few years later in March 1879, Edward Mills arrives in Mott's Corners and takes over operation of the store shortly thereafter. The following news item from Mott's Corners, approximately nine months after the Mills family arrived, describes a "firm of Mills & Co.", and I believe this is likely an early reference to Edward's business, and if true, it would seem to indicate that Edward still had co-owners, possibly still including Charles M. Pine and James A. Hillyer, who were his partners in the {{% pagelink "corfu" "Corfu store" %}}. By the 1890's the store was referenced simply as "E. H. Mills", and informally called "Mills' Store". (Charles Pine was financially ruined by his son Alverade in early 1891 and he died in 1897.) 

{{% fig "brookton/1879-12-03-Ithaca-Daily-Journal-Ithaca-NY-p4" "500" /%}}

I haven't yet found another reference to this firm, and presumably if a reference could be found prior to the Mills' move to Mott's Corners, that fact would presumably rule out a connection to the Mills family. But I will also note that in the 1880 Caroline  census, I do not see anyone else with the last name Mills. So, although I cannot directly link this firm to Edward H. Mills, I am inclined to believe, based on the circumstantial evidence, that this firm is likely Edward Mills', and if true, this could provide an important clue to not only their first months Mott's Corners, but it could also possibly point to the reason why they chose to move to Mott's Corners specifically.

(I have also considered the possibility that this is a misspelling of a similar name, such as "Mulks", "Miles" or perhaps even "Miller".  There is also a farmer in Caroline with the name Gills. I will also note that in January 1875, there is a "new Ithaca poultry journal, to be called 'The Poultry Organ'" (02 Jan 1875, Ithaca Daily Journal, Ithaca NY, p4). I have not found this publication yet, but it may provide more context.)

The 1880 United States Federal Census for Caroline shows Edward is a "merchant" and his son Jonas is a "clerk in store".

{{% fig "mills-home/masons/1880-06-15-US-Census-caroline-p21" "800" /%}}

Correspondingly in 1880, George T. Sanders and wife Maria are living in Cortland with their daughter [Sarah F. (Sanders) Edwards](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338800/sarah-f-edwards) (09 Oct 1840 to 10 May 1896), who married [Nelson G. Edwards](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338799/nelson_g_edwards) (01 Aug 1835 to 21 Nov 1920).  George T. listed his occupation as “retired merchant”, and he lived the rest of his life in Cortland.

Edward Mills' surviving children Jonas and Emily clerk in their father's store, and they also both become members of High Bridge Lodge shortly after arriving in Mott's Corners. Mills' store is indirectly mentioned in the High Bridge Lodge meeting minutes notebook On 20 Feb 1885: "Worthy Chief and two girls retired to the store for refreshments." (Tompkins County History Center, Ithaca NY.)

Long-time community members call this building "The Old Post Office" referring to when it was used as such starting in 1961 under postmaster Charles Vorhis. But the post office had also been in that building many years prior, moving there when Edward Mills became postmaster.

It appears [George H. Richardson](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/189275611/george-h-richardson) (May 1862 to 26 Feb 1938) was an employee of Edward's, as he is never identified as the official postmaster in the USPS records. George also appears to be yet another person who was mentored in the grocery business and eventually began his own store.

The following are some of the earliest references to Mills' store, detailing misadventures that took place while Emily was known to be a "clerk" at the store:

In its Caroline materials, The Tompkins County History Center in Ithaca NY has a reproduction of a newspaper clipping of a poem that is prefaced with: “Written for, and Recited at the Poet's Entertainment at the Congregational Church, Brookton, Feb. 6, 1897, by Mrs. Ella E. Mandeville.” I cannot find the original citation information. The following three stanzas from Ella’s poem describe Mulk’s general store, the postoffice in the rear of Mulk’s store, and then, E. H. Mills general store, stating that it was “one more of like design” and emphasizing the fairness and honesty of the “obliging, pleasant owners”:

<figure>

<pre>

There's a store lately modeled
  For convenience; partly new,
With clean yellow painted surface,
  Trimmed about with darker hue;
Where, arranged upon the counters
  And the shelves of ample space
And in glass cases, Yankee notions, 
  Dry goods, substantials, lace,
Trimmings for dress goods, modeled 
  As Dame Fashion last designed,
With a host of other features,
  In its roomy space you find.
Pharmaceutics, too, is practiced;
  School book, boots and shoes are sold;
Groceries of all descriptions.
  Parceled out for standard gold, 
Or for silver, butter, hen's-eggs,
  Or for promise of good pay.
One may take the goods and use them 
  And can pay some other day.

Half-way down its length established, 
  Is a place where, morn and eve,
Niece and nephew wait expectant,
  For what "Uncle Sam" may give.

Just across the public highway,
  Is one more of like design
As regards its inner contents,
  Indicated by the sign.
Step within, and look around you.
  Great variety you find.
And obliging, pleasant owners,
  Ready every want to mind.
Years of honest, faithful dealing,
  Confidence and trust inspire.
Weight and measure always honest, 
  All will find their fair dealing there.

  - Ella E. (Card) Mandeville (27 Jul 1863 to 14 Dec 1948) is the second wife of Theodore F. Mandeville (04 Jun 1845 to 20 Jan 1935). (17 Dec 1948, Lewiston Daily Sun, Lewiston, ME, p2 and 31 Jan 1935, Brunswick Record, Brunswick ME, p4.) Theodore’s first wife was Harriet Augusta “Hattie” (Ault) Mandeville, who was a founding member of the Congregational Church of Mott’s Corners before she was married.

  - Several years earlier, Frank Mulks purchased the general store that at that time was known as Lounsbery & Norwood’s store: “Frank Mulks for a long time with S. Harris, in this city, has purchased Lounsbery & Norwood’s stock of goods at Brookton and will take possession this week. (22 May 1889, Ithaca Daily Journal, Ithaca NY, p3, q31.) On 31 Oct 1893, Frank Mulks became Brookton postmaster, and was succeeded by Fred B. Lounsbery on 29 Nov 1897 (usps.com), but during both of these terms, the postoffice was in the back of Mulk’s store, confirming the description of the postoffice in the second stanza quoted above. 

  - A handwritten note on the item states: "sent Jan 1975 by Edison Signor of Spencer from his father's scrapbook".

The following shows that the Mills' store was involved in charity while Edward was alive:

{{% fig "1904-08-29-The-Ithaca-Daily-Journal-p6" "500" /%}}

I have seen perhaps more than a dozen volumes of sales journals and other financial record books that are in the possession of a local collector who told me he was contacted by Frank Proto at the time Frank took possession of the former Mills' store building, and he was given the opportunity to go through the basement of the building and preserve anything of historical value. 

{{% fig "me-mills/vol-41-spine" "800" /%}}

Interestingly, the oldest of the volumes, labeled "No. 41" is the most important as it shows the records of E. H. Mills in the days immediately preceding Edward's death. It seems Emily herself (or perhaps Jessie Brewer after her) did not preserve the books from her father's time running the store.

{{% fig "me-mills/1908-records-high-res-lower-third" "800" /%}}

The "Mills Family a/c" pages show the Mills' business expenses, mostly paying for store inventory. In these earlier books, this information was at the end of the book, starting with the inside back cover and progressed toward the front over time, whereas retail sales, including what the family themselves took out of the store, were entered in the books in the normal order, starting from the front and working toward the back.

The Mills Family account in the months following Edward's death: 

{{% fig "me-mills/1908-03-04-sales-journal" "800" /%}}

The store was open on New Year's eve and New Year's day 1908, the day Edward died, and Emily was working on an otherwise typical day of business at the store:

<div class="cols">
{{% fig "me-mills/1907-dec-31-sales-journal-p16" "350" /%}}
{{% fig "me-mills/1908-01-01-sales-journal" "350" /%}}
</div>

As you look at these sale entries, understand that you are seeing Emily continue a practice that she learned from her father, just as her brothers had learned from him in [Corfu]({{% relref "corfu" %}}), and [George Richardson]({{% relref "richardson-george" %}}) had also learned from him in Brookton. Edward in turn had learned this practice from his older brother-in-law Charles M. Pine in [Staten Island]({{% relref "staten-island" %}}), where Charles also taught this practice to James Hillyer, Bartlett Brown, and Charles' son Theodore, among others. 

As you can see, these books contain many easily recognizable names of former Brookton residents, along with their regular purchases. It is interesting to note the store was closed on Sundays, but open on Christmas day, if a bit slow:

{{% fig "me-mills/1908-12-25-sales-journal-p466" "800" /%}}

And some examples of Emily's own entries in the sales logs. Essentially, this is a glimpse inside Emily and Hannah's pantry. Emily may have had a bit of a sweet tooth, as candy was one of the more common staples:

<div class="cols">

By 1920, her daily records looked much the same.

{{% fig "me-mills/1920-01-19-Sales-Journals-p233" "800" /%}}

In the 1920's, more sophisticated business records emerge, both new types of records kept as well as a more formal breakdown of the store's inventory expenditures. These journals contained sample pages and instructions that Emily may have used to teach herself these new methods. This is further indication of Emily's character and how much pride she took in ownership of her store that she was continually teaching herself new practices, even after decades of daily work in this occupation.

Several descriptions of M. E. Mills exist, the most complete of which is Gertrude Conant's:

{{% fig "conant-gertrude-1" "800" /%}}

In one of the present-day photos of 484 Brooktondale Road, you can see the staircase on the side of building leading to the second floor, that Gertrude mentions. The second floor was known as **Lounsbery Hall** for owner Edward Lounsbery, who purchased the property on 12 Oct 1874 from George E. Sanders, Edward's brother-in-law. 

Various community groups were known to meet there,  including the David Ireland Post of the G.A.R., the Grange, and the High Bridge Lodge of the temperance group, the Good Templars, of which Edward and Amanda Lounsbery, George T. Sanders' family, George Richardson, William B. Wolcott, and Emily and Jonas Mills were members. (George Richardson and Emily Mills both acted in the locally produced play *The Colleen Bawn* at Lounsbery Hall as well as several other locations, for the benefit of High Bridge Lodge.

Lounsbery Hall was a popular event venue and community space for years.

In Molly’s research notes, she gives the attribution: “[Driveby, ie Conant]" and I have confirmed with Barbara Kone that Gertrude wrote the Brooktondale portions of the "Drive-by" book:

{{% fig "a-note-on-emily-mills" "800" /%}}

The answer to Molly's question "and some groceries?" seems to be yes. Perhaps the question arose because Jessie Brewer apparently did not continue to sell groceries, and this was what residents of the time would more likely remember.

Barbara Kone and others have searched the Caroline History Room for the “leatherette booklet” Molly mentioned, but it has not yet been found. Fortunately, Molly had the foresight to keep printed reproductions in her file folders:

{{% fig "me-mills/me-mills-1-improved" "800" /%}}

And Molly retained a printed reproduction of the following item; the location of the original is currently unknown to me:

As Molly describes in her "Note", Emily began aggressively advertising the newly branded store in 1909. She advertised perhaps dozens of times in the Ithaca Daily Journal alongside the Vorhis Mill and the meat market that is attributed at one time to Clarence Wheeler, someone mentioned many times in the journals of George Jansen. The first such advertisement I could find was in the 29 Mar 1909 edition (exactly 30 years after the Mills moved to Motts Corners), and the last was on 30 Jun 1910. What follows are a sample of some of them, many of which were repeated for weeks at a time, and they provide a good sense of the diverse products offered in the small country store:

In the Ithaca Daily Journal, 26 Aug 1909, pg 5, in an article "Early History of Brookton Village" M. E. Mills is listed as a "present merchant".

We know a great deal about Emily through the activities of M. E. Mills, which Emily made a community focal point as a natural consequence of her many interests and activities, and intentional or not, had to have been excellent marketing for her store. My impressions are that Emily took a great deal of pride in the running of her store and took its effective management very seriously and did indeed consider every opportunity to volunteer her store for free press and increased foot traffic, such as the regular millinery exhibits by Margaret LaBar.

[Miss Margaret "Maggie" LaBar (1880 to 1979)](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/88609026/margaret-labar) is the daughter of farmer [William Edgar LaBar](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/54156769/william_e_labar) (04 Dec 1839 to 1937) and [Sarah W. (Dan) Labar](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/54156944/sarah_w_labar) (1842 to 1912). In the 1880 United States Federal Census for Caroline NY, "Magie B." appears to be a few weeks old, as her age given as "15/30". (Ibid. p15.) In the 1900 census, the family was living next to Jerome Miller, the Brookton Depot station agent. So, Margaret LaBar was presumably well known to Emily for years prior to her "millinery displays". 

In the 1905 New York State Census, the family moved to Danby and the 1930 Federal Census indicates they were living in Danby on Bald Hill Road. The 1905 census lists the first occupation for Margaret: "fancy work" or decorative needlework. In later censuses, her occupation is "seamstress".

In the 1880 Federal Census and the 1905 State Census, her name is spelled "Magie" with one "g". "LaBar" also has several variations in spelling. In relation to the Mills' store, it is consistently spelled "La Barre" however, Margaret did many similar store displays in which her name is consistently spelled "LaBarr". The same is true of many of her mentions in the Danby gossip columns, where both "LaBarr" and "LaBar" are used. "LaBarr" is used in Margaret's own notices and advertisements: she advertised the sale of millinery supplies from her home in Danby, and she also owned a home that she rented. The intermixing of "LaBar" and "LaBarr" occur over many decades, and even her father's obituary spells the family name as "LaBarr". Yet the grave markers say "LABAR" and census data consistently show spelling/capitalization of "LaBar".

Although I have only had limited access to the Mills' store journals--and therefore cannot claim to have reviewed them carefully or completely--I do not recall ever seeing expenses for leasing the Mills store space. While most of the business expenses in the journals are understandably for inventory, many other types of business expenses are also recorded there. Perhaps payment was on a longer schedule and I simply didn't see the entries.

Shortly after Dr. Lockwood's death in 1934, his widow [Mittie A. (Peer) Lockwood](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/97943261/mittie-a-lockwood) (10 Nov 1863 to 11 Oct 1939) sold the property to Jessie Brewer, days before Mills' store was burglarized.

Two articles in the 14 Jul 1934 (p3) and 20 Nov 1934 (p5) issues of The Ithaca Journal tell of $135 in cash being stolen from M. E. Mills while Emily "was at lunch." Despite the information being publicly available, I have chosen not to republish it here out of respect to any descendants of those accused.

{{% fig "1935-10-25-ithaca-journal" "500" /%}}

Identical notices for the Halloween party ran in The Ithaca Journal on 28 Oct and 29 Oct 1935.

And in the following, Molly Adams seems to indicate "at the store" refers to what is presently known as Brookton's Market, owned by Robert (Bob) Tucker at that time, and not M. E. Mills, although her choice of words is noticeably vague on the point. Presumably, I can find the original quote and get a better sense of this, but it's not obvious this isn't referring to Mills' store:

<figure>
<blockquote>
...At Old Home Day in 1935 Professor Edwin Shurter proposed a memorial to Dr. Lockwood: those who wished to contribute could sign up "at the store." This store in the center of town, with the post office attached, had become, and remains, a village hub.

The memorial, presumably with the text provided by the professor, currently sits outside of Dalebrook Apartments, near the southwest corner of the structure, directly across the street from the former location of Mills' store, and facing the former Lockwood residence. There is also a bronze sundial on top of the stone (not visible in the photo) that appears to have been attached along with the tablet.

As noted in other histories, Jessie Brewer took over the store at the same location, running it under her name primarily as a notions store with a lending library in the back, but unlike Mills', Jessie Brewer did not carry groceries. 

{{% fig "me-mills/brewer-ad" "500" /%}}

Jessie Brewer ran a dry goods store in Brooktondale, selling fabric, ribbon, greeting cards, and other items.

She was also active in the Caroline Valley Federated (now Community) Church.

1961, Postmaster Charles Vorhis bought Jessie Brewer's store and moved the post office across the street. This store had been Mr. Mills dry goods store and was carried on for thirty years after his death by his daughter Emily Mills, who carried kerosene, kerosene lamps with green shades, penny candy, stockings, handkerchiefs, yard goods, pins and sewing notions, sheets and pillowcases. Emily Mills died in 1937. Jessie Brewer, who grew up in the house next door as Jessie Shurter, kept a dry goods store here after Miss Mills and had a lending library in the back of the store. (The Shurter House, which sat between the post office and the bridge, was moved to 447 Brooktondale Road in 1964 when the road was improved.)

Bea Raponi may be the last living person with first-hand memories of Emily and her store. She told me that enough time has passed that she doesn't believe she could identify Emily in photos. I invited her to write down anything about Emily she does remember and send it to me for inclusion with these materials.

03 Aug 2022, Frank Proto offered to let me look around Mills' store building, which I had only been inside once prior. At this time, only a small space downstairs was used by Frank as an office, while the upstairs was an apartment, although it was unrented at the time.

Frank mentioned that he had removed the old linoleum flooring from the time of the Vorhis post-office, exposing the hardwood beneath. The antique metal ceiling was also added.

There are potentially artifacts from the time of Mills' store in the building. There are a number of items that predate Vorhis' ownership, including old wooden mailboxes that may have been used when Edward was postmaster. There are also old wooden boxes with food brands painted on them.

The basement is accessed from a door that opens in the floor. This door is near a large exterior door where deliveries were likely made. The basement floor is fine dirt.

Frank speculates that the upstairs rear room may have been used for masonic meetings, and pointed out that an interior door contained a large peep-hole. 

Mills' store is easily visible from most windows in most rooms of Mills' Home. 

## The Brewer Barn

The Mills' home is the only real estate that I can find official documentation for the Mills' owning in Tompkins County. Yet in the sales journals of [E. H. Mills]({{% relref "me-mills" %}}) general store in Brookton, the inside front cover of volume 41 indicates the purchase of a barn on 23 Sep 1907 that was rented to John Roe for $0.50 a month starting in 1908:

{{% fig "me-mills/1907-09-23-barn-rent" "800" /%}}

There was a barn on the Mills' home property at one time, but by 1907, it was on land owned by the Mills since they purchased the property from Edward and Amanda Lounsbery 05 Jan 1903 (Deeds 157, p593): 

{{% fig "brookton/maps/1912-highway-bf033282-001-p2-lower-cropped" "800" /%}}
{{% fig "brookton/maps/1912-highway-bf033282-001-p2-lower-hb" "800" /%}}

There is only one other deed I have found associated with the Mills’ family, and it was a transaction that Emily helped facilitate between Willis Shurter and his wife Betsey:

<div class="cols">
{{% fig "mills-home/deeds-171-334" "350" /%}}
{{% fig "mills-home/deeds-171-335" "350" /%}}
</div>

Notice that these deeds include an affidavit from Dr. Lockwood.

I have searched both 1907 and 1908 deed books, for both Caroline and Danby, for the following names: Lounsbery, Lockwood, Mills, Mulks, Roe, Reid and Shurter, and  I have not found a deed that corresponds to this date or that explicitly describes a barn. Interestingly, there is a real estate transaction between Amanda Lounsbery and John Roe earlier in 1907, that is perhaps related to the barn rental: 

{{% fig "mills-home/deeds-164-253-lounsbery-roe" "800" /%}}

Perhaps the purchase indicated was not by the Mills, but by Edward and Amanda Lounsbery, or possibly Jessie Shurter, and the Mills were providing a service on behalf of the barn owner , to collect and account for these transactions at a convenient existing business already frequented by community members. 

Note in the survey maps below, the existence of a structure labeled "Brewer Barn", at the rear of the Lockwood property and behind the Mulks and Lockwood barns, that may be the barn in question. A note indicates that "Brewer uses this driveway by permit". Jessie Brewer owned the store at that time and the driveway leads from the store to the barn.

{{% fig "brookton/maps/A-1-Book-p16-rotated" "800" /%}}
{{% fig "brookton/maps/BF127082-001-book-272-p322" "800" /%}}

The documentary evidence indicates that the Brewer Barn was "Willis Shurter's Wagon Shop in Motts Corners".

In the description of the oldest deed for Mulks's Home at present day 478 Brooktondale Road that I have yet found, from 04 Jun 1870, Caroline Deeds 3, p181, Jacob Vandemark, Charles W. Personeus & Marcie E. his wife to Jacob Vandemark, it states that the property begins "in the center of the 'Creek Road' and 113 links westerly from a line with the west side of Willis Shurter's Wagon Shop in Motts Corners..." This description is repeated in the next transfer on 27 Nov 1889 (Deeds 135/113), and only in the next transfer on 22 Oct 1896 (Deeds 146, p481) does the description change to "...what was **formerly** known as Willis Shurter's Wagon Shop in Motts Corners..." (emphasis added). 

The matching distance of 113 links indicated on Map A1, p16 shown above confirms that this describes the western edge of the "lane" between the Lockwood Residence at present-day 480 Brooktondale Road and the Mills' Store structure. This "lane" and the "Brewer Barn" were always conveyed with the store lot until 11 Jun 1963, when Jessie Brewer transfers **both the "lane" and the barn** to Arthur and Dorothy Wells, at which point, they became part of the Lockwood Residence lot, and they remain so as I write this. This also explains why the stairway to the second floor (Lounsbery Hall) of Mills’ Store, on the western side of the building, has since that time encroached onto the Lockwood lot. 

Willis Shurter inherited his father Josiah's properties, including the Shurter House and the lower grist mill. Josiah Shurter is listed in the census as a "wagon maker" (1870) and in 1875 both he and son-in-law William Benton Wolcott share the occupation "carriage maker".

Immediately after mustering out of the Union Army, William is living with his wife Ellen, her father Josiah, and her brother Willis.

{{% fig "census/1865-NYS-census-caroline-p34" "800" /%}}

Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that William Benton Wolcott worked for his father-in-law and/or brother-in-law at some point, and that this work was in the Brewer Barn. Josiah's son Willis inherited his father's properties and business interests by the late 1860's, and the store property was eventually purchased by Willis' and Betsey's daughter Jessie Brewer.

(Willis Shurter's first wife, identified as "Jane" in the store deeds, was [Mary Jane "Jennie" (German) Shurter](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100597023/jennie-shurter) (1845 to 12 Mar 1872). It is Willis Shurter's second wife [Betsey Alvira "Betty" (Merrill) Shurter](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/99603648/betsey-a-shurter) (1847 to 04 Jul 1932), whom he married in 1876, who is the mother of [Jessie M. (Shurter) Brewer](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/99536961/jessie-m-brewer) (27 Jun 1881 to 16 Sep 1974).)

Willis Shurter was a Civil War veteran who had "been an invalid a number of years" (15 Jan 1914, The Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p9, newspapers.com).

{{% fig "me-mills/1914-01-19-The-Ithaca-Journal-Ithaca-NY-p6" "500" /%}}

The Brewer Barn still exists as I write this, and in a conversation on 19 May 2023, Frank Proto told me that according to what he was told by Charles Vorhis many years ago: Jessie Brewer rented horses and carriages from this barn in the distant past.

## Notes for Future Researchers

In the Caroline History Room in Slaterville Springs, there are a set of similar looking general store sales journals that appear to belong to Mulk's general store which was in the same location as Brookton's Market today.

<div class="cols">
{{% fig "me-mills/vorhis-sales-1" "350" /%}}
{{% fig "me-mills/vorhis-sales-2" "350" /%}} 
</div>

Notice the familiar names: William B. Wolcott, Willis Shurter, George R. Peck, and Jerome Miller, the station agent at Brookton Depot.

These volumes are leather bound, but with badly deteriorating covers, containing entries from the 1890's to the early 190X's. I could not find anything in the volumes themselves directly identifying the store these journals were for, but I only reviewed the books briefly. A note accompanying them indicated they were donated by Frank Proto, owner of both Dalebrook and the Mills' store location at the time of this writing.  

Given that Frank donated them, and that the style of record keeping is quite similar to known Mills sales journals, I initially hoped these might be earlier books of E. H. Mills' general store. When asked for more information on their origin, Barbara Kone said they came from Frank's basement, and when pressed further for which basement, she said "from the Mill" meaning the basement of Dalebrook. In a later conversation with Frank Proto, he confirmed that he donated these volumes on "permanent loan" to the Caroline History Room, and that they came from the basement of Dalebrook, when Frank purchased the property from Charles Vorhis. 

At the time of the sales journals in question, the general store next to Dalebrook was Frank F. Mulks general store, presently, Brookton's Market, and it appears the prices used in the comparisons in the {{% pagelink "2011-calendar-brooktons-market" %}} came from these books, indicating that the calendar's creators linked these books to Mulks's store. 

My review led me to conclude there were possibly several different handwriting styles, and although I have not looked through the entries thoroughly, I spent a little time reviewing a random sampling of entries over several books and based on my familiarity with Emily's writing, I concluded that I did not find examples of it in these journals. Obviously a more careful examination should be done, but in the meantime, the weight of the evidence leads me to also conclude that these sales journals most likely came from Mulks' store.
