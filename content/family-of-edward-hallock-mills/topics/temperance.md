Emily, Hannah, and Ellen were each known to be active in temperance, primarily in the Women's Christian Temperance Union (W.C.T.U.), although Emily and her brother Jonas, were also members of the High Bridge Lodge #296 of the Independent Order of Good Templars, in Brookton. The temperance movement was a significant cultural phenomenon of the mid 1800's to the early 1900's, and was particularly strong among the religious communities of upstate NY. There was significant overlap between members of the temperance movement and those supporting suffrage, and before that, abolition.

Prior to the Mills moving to Mott's Corners, it is unclear if Emily Mills or anyone else in the family was involved in temperance.

> Temperance groups don't appear to be very strong here. The only mention I found was the "Royal Templars of Temperance" who began meeting in 1878. They didn't seem to be very powerful. No date was given as to when they ceased to exist.

There are records of a number of "lodges" of the Independent Order of Good Templars in the Batavia area. There was at least briefly a Corfu lodge of the Good Templars, No. 822, although I don't yet know if Emily was a member there.

This lodge apparently disbanded prior to 1885.

Emily Mills joined the existing “High Bridge Lodge No. 296” of the Independent Order of Good Templars shortly after arriving in Mott’s Corners, as she "furnished entertainment for the good of the order" in August 1879. (20 Aug 1879, Ithaca Daily Journal, Ithaca NY, p4.) She was a member until at least August 1886, as attested by the meeting minutes of the Good Templars at that time. She often contributed to the “Good of the Order” portions of meetings in which members volunteered in advance to contribute something of educational and/or entertainment value, such as reading a poem or essay. She held a number of offices over the years, and was Secretary when the lodge disbanded in 1886. "Emily Mills Sec." are the final words recorded for High Bridge Lodge 296.

At the turning of the 20th century, at least in Caroline, the Good Templars and other temperance organizations appear to lose influence, and those dedicated to temperance seemed to coalesce around the Women’s Christian Temperance Union.
