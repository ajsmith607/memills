title: "Have you seen Emily Mills?"

One of my initial goals when starting this research was to find photos of the Mills family, the home, and their store in Brookton. In particular, I want to know what Emily looked like.

Unfortunately, no known photos of the Mills family exists. To my knowledge, as I write this, there is only one remaining living soul in Caroline who interacted with Emily: a current Brooktondale resident in her 90's who visited Emily's store as a child, and who decades later would work in the Mills' store location when it became "the old postoffice". Although she remembers Emily quite fondly, she does not think her memory is good enough to identify Emily in photos today.

It is quite probable that there simply is no photo to find. But how do you even look for a photo of someone when you don't have a way to directly identify them in photos? My strategy has been to learn as much about the circumstances of their lives as possible, not only in the hopes of finding photos along the way, but also to help in the identification of other people closely associated with Emily.

We have some clues to Emily's appearance. Gertrude Conant states:

Emily Mills was a little woman, with her hair in a bun on top of her head, like Grandma Baconâ€™s. She was quiet, neat, cheerful and always smiling.

Gertrude also mentions that Ellen Gould "looked a great deal like Miss Mills". But Ellen was also a full decade older than Emily.

I am starting to get photos of closer relatives to help identify Emily. There is a photo of Emily's uncle, Edward's brother, in his later years, and he appears to also be a person of average size at best, corroborating Gertrude's basic description.

I have only found one distantly related Mills descendant online who also is unaware of any photos of Edward's family. I will continue to search for living Mills descendants, although this has been difficult. (None of the Mills children had children, nor did Hannah have any direct descendants.)

I have likewise contacted a living descendent of Ellen Gould, and she is not aware of any existing photos of Ellen. I am researching Hannah's genealogy and it appears there a number of living descendants of her brother David, and I have started contacting them. There may be a photo of David, and I am hoping that photos of Hannah's siblings will help us identify Hannah in any photos, and if we can identify Hannah in a photo, the photo may also include Edward, Emily, or Ellen Gould, whose identities we may be able to infer.

I have also been familiarizing myself with Emily's peers in Brookton, not just as potential sources of information and photos, but also to identify them and to rule them out in any photos that might also show Emily. For example, I have a very clear photo of Anna Mulks, Emily's friend and neighbor, and there are several clear photos of Jessie Brewer I have seen. Both of these women, as well as many others, may be in photos with Hannah and Emily. (I have not delved deeply into their genealogies, but neither of these women had children either.)

Caroline Valley Community Church has been very generous with access to their historical records including photos. I've done a fairly thorough search and did not find photos of any of the Mills in their materials.

Finally, there is a photo of a woman minding a general store in Caroline, contained in the photo book "Around Caroline" but the woman and the store are not identified, and I don't know the source of the photo. I have made multiple attempts to contact the author of the book without success, and Barabara Kone does not believe that this photo came from the Caroline History Room collection.
