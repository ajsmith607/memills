Edward H. Mills' ancestors were early settlers of Edward's birthplace, the Town of Smithtown on Long Island, and to this day the [Mills Pond District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mills_Pond_District_(St._James,_New_York)) is named for them.

<blockquote>
The Mills on Long Island were of English descent and it would seem quite clear that they came from Yorkshire, England, to this country about 1630, locating at first in New England and some of them soon after on Long Island. The Hempstead settlement on Long Island, which began about 1644 and where the name of George Mills was found on the town records, was called a Yorkshire settlement. When Long Island was captured by the English from the Dutch they found on the west end a Yorkshire settlement called Long Island Yorkshire.

The following two accounts of George Mills are presented for completeness, but note there are inconsistent points between them:

The original Mills Homestead, now more commonly called the Mills Pond House, built by Timothy Mills and added onto by William Wickham Mills, still exists today "to exhibit the artwork of regional and national artists. The arts council also holds art classes and special events for residents of all ages." ([Mills Pond Gallery](https://www.millspondgallery.org/), millspondgallery.org.) The Mills Pond District, which includes nine buildings, the Mills Pond House among them, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. ([Mills Pond District (St. James, New York)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mills_Pond_District_(St._James,_New_York)), wikipedia.org.)

<blockquote>
In an elegant old home on North Country Road in St. James, visitors can find the impressive art gallery of the Smithtown Township Arts Council. The structure, known as the Mills Pond House, holds the work of talented artists and also represents a piece of Smithtown history.

It was Timothy Mills who bought the land from one of our town founder's sons in 1693, according to "Colonel Rockwell's Scrap-Book" published by the Smithtown Historical Society in 1968. As the sons of Timothy Mills married, houses were built around the pond found on the land.

In the early 1700s, the area became known as Mills Pond. According to the Smithtown Township Arts Council's website, the area was originally called Cuttscunsuck, which means two small ponds in the Algonquian language.

The original house that was built by Timothy Mills before 1700 was partially destroyed by a fire, according to "Colonel Rockwell's Scrap-book". William Wickham Mills, a descendant of Timothy, restored the damaged part of the house and built a three-story addition in 1838.

Smithtown historian Bradley Harris said William Wickham Mills was one of the richest men in Suffolk County. He was a farmer and also a prominent landlord owning a large amount of land in Smithtown's Landing area. William Wickham Mills also served as Town Supervisor of Smithtown from 1838 – 1841.

According to the arts council website, a noted New York City architect by the name of Calvin Pollard designed the Mills Pond House. An example of Grecian design, materials such as English glass, Connecticut stone and Santo Domingo mahogany were used contributing to its elegance.

Harris said, "It was the most magnificent house in Smithtown."

According to the scrap-book, in 1846 a daughter of William Wickham Mills married into Smithtown's Smith family. When he died in 1865, his grandson Dubois Smith inherited the home and land. It was later passed on to Dubois Smith's two daughters Josephine and Mildred Smith, who donated the house to the Town of Smithtown in 1976.

Soon after the donation of the home to the town, the Smithtown Township Arts Council has been using the Mills Pond House to exhibit the artwork of regional and national artists. The arts council also holds art classes and special events for residents of all ages.

Despite modern adaptations such as gallery lighting and handicap access, the structure has remained basically unchanged. Visitors to the home can still find formal porticoes and marble mantelpieces. 

The regal Mills Pond House provides the perfect location to expose Smithtown residents to art and also reminds us of a noted local family and our rich history.

A portrait of William Wickham Mills is presented further below in connection with the artist William Sidney Mount.

Many photos of the Mills Pond House, both historic and contemporary, exist online and in collections such as the Library of Congress. As an historic building, there is also substantial documentation on the structure itself, including detailed information on renovations and restorations over the generations, that is publicly available. Just to the west of the Mills Pond House is the Mills Cemetery (also referred to as Mills Pond Cemetery, Mills Burying Ground, and Mills Graveyard) where many of Emily's ancestors are buried. 

Edward H. Mills has partial entries on the following Mills family genealogies:
 
1. *Descendants of George Mills of Yorkshire and Long Island, New York* at MillsAncestry.org. That site is now defunct and the contact information for it is no longer valid, however, an archived version exists, and I was able to locate its creator on Facebook to let him know about this documentation on Edward. This genealogy is dated 07 Aug 2003.

2. *Genealogies of Long Island families : a collection of genealogies relating to the following Long Island families: Dickerson, Mitchill, Wickham, Carman, Raynor, Rushmore, Satterly, Hawkins, Arthur Smith, Mills, Howard, Lush, Greene*, Compiled by Charles J. Werner, Mainly From Records Left By Benjamin F. Thompson, Historian of Long Island, Logan Utah FamilySearch Library, familysearch.org. This genealogy is dated 1919.

3. *A Documentary History of the Family of Mills : descended from George Mills of Hempstead and Jamaica* by Lewis D. Cook, familysearch.org. This genealogy is dated 01 May 1939 and appears to use #2 above as a source. "With notes on the Miller and Hawkins families compiled for Frances Paton Mills (Mrs. Robert B. Carnahan, Jr.) of New York City."

John B. Mills, who has done considerable genealogical research on his family, confirms that the 1939 *A Documentary History of the Family of Mills.* is "very accurate". (14 Feb 2024, personal correspondence.) I also asked John for any information on Edward's family that he may have encountered in his own research.

Add to these genealogies, Edward's branch to its ultimate conclusion:

<span>1030.</span> **Edward Hallock Mills** (born 25 Mar 1819, Smithtown NY, died 01 Jan 1908, Brookton NY).

Edward married (1) **Mary Ann (Pine) Mills** (born 08 Feb 1819, Hempstead NY, died 28 Dec 1895, Brookton NY) on 29 Dec 1850. 

Children:
  - **Jonas Edward Mills** (born 18 Feb 1852, Staten Island NY, 1852, died 14 Oct 1885, Brookton NY).
  - **Horace Franklin Mills** (born 04 Aug 1854, Staten Island NY, 1854, died 21 Oct 1876, Corfu NY).
  - **James Wheelock Mills** (born 1856?, Staten Island NY, died between 31 July 1857 and 19 Jun 1860, Staten Island NY).
  - **Mary Emily Mills** who went by "Emily" and often signed her name as "M. Emily Mills" (born Dec 1858, Staten Island NY, died 03 Nov 1937, Brooktondale NY).
  
None of Edward's children married or had children.

Edward married (2) **Hannah (Thatcher) Eastman Mills** (born Hawkhurst, Kent, England, 21 May 1824, died 12 Feb 1917, Brookton NY) on 30 Dec 1896. 

  - No children.

Notes:
  - According to [WikiTree](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hallock-2194) Mary (Hallock) Mills was born in Mills Pond and "is interred at the Old Cemetery, Smithtown, Suffolk, NY." This source also confirms that her father is Thomas, but gives his birth year as 1775. Read more about Thomas Hallock's identity in the [Hallock section]({{% relref "hallock" %}}) of this research.
  - That there are conflicting accounts for the month of Jonas and Mary Hallock's marriage is suggestive, as December would mean that Edward was conceived before his parents were married, February would not.
  - Edward's middle name Hallock was his Mother's maiden name. Although most typically spelled "Hallock" there are occasionally alternate spellings of this name in the Mills and Hallock genealogies, such as "Halliock" and "Hallioch". For more information on the various spellings of Hallock see [this section]({{% relref "hallock#alternate-spellings-of-hallock" %}}).
  - Mary Platt's parents were also members of Smithtown Presbyterian Church. 
  - Emily's and Hannah's birth dates was well as the birth places for Emily, Jonas and Horace are based on census entries.
  - It appears Edward named his second son after his father, and Emily may get her middle name from Edward's sister who passed over a decade before Emily was born. 
  - More than one source corroborates that Emily Tabitha Mills married John Smith Huntting on 14 Dec 1843.
  - Further below, I will demonstrate that Edward's brother, listed in each genealogy as "Thomas James Mills" was in fact James Thomas Mills, born 13 Feb 1827. 

Several of the marriages above and below are referenced in the volume *Early marriage records of the Mills family in the United States : official and authoritative records of Mills marriages in the original states and colonies from 1628 to 1865* published in 1916 by William Montgomery Clemens, accessed via ancestry.com:

It is perhaps interesting to note that in *Genealogies of Long Island Families*, it is said about [William Henry Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/23872257/william-henry-mills) (03 Apr 1836 to 28 Dec 1900), grandson of Jedediah and Elizabeth Mills, Mary Platt's parents: "At the age of nineteen William Henry Mills engaged in the mercantile business in Staten Island and continued thusly for four years when he returned to Smithtown" (p109). This is corroborated by *A Documentary History of the Family of Mills*:

<div class="cols">
{{% fig "genealogy/Genealogies-L-I-Families-p111-william-henry" "350" /%}}
{{% fig "long-island/A-Documentary-History-Mills-p62" "350" /%}}
</div>

In other words, William Henry's time in Staten Island, approximately 1855 to 1859, is a period during which Edward Mills' family was known to be living in Staten Island, Edward himself engaged in what might be described as "the mercantile business". In fact, Edward's career was described in a strikingly similar way on 31 Dec 1895, The Daily News, Batavia NY, p1, in Mary Ann Mills' obituary, which describes Edward's move from Corfu to Mott's Corners as him "re-engaging in mercantile pursuits".

{{% fig "1882-02-10-The-Long-Islander-Huntington-NY-p3" "500" /%}}

Jonas' obituary, noted that he lived in Hempstead "with the exception of a few years", which included 1850, where he is recorded in the United States Federal Census in Islip NY, at age 55, a "farmer". The family appears to return to Smithtown by 1851, when Mary Platt is readmitted to Smithtown Presbyterian on 03 Jan 1851 and then returns to Hempstead as evidenced by her removal from the church, "by certificate to Hempstead" 05 Jun 1858. 

{{% fig "long-island/1850-United-States-Federal-Census-islip-NY" "800" /%}}

{{% fig "genealogy/smithtown-presbyterian/158" "800" /%}}

It should be noted that **Edward's brother born on 13 Feb 1827 is James Thomas Mills (also written as J. Thomas Mills) NOT Thomas James Mills**. The confusion with the name may arise because it seems that he commonly wrote his name as "J. Thomas Mills", and based on the obituary for his son Watts, this was apparently often shortened to just "Thomas". Also, in some census records, it does appear that his name is written as Thomas J. Otherwise, the only places that give "Thomas" as his first name are the two main Mills genealogies cited as 2 and 3 in the list above, and source 3 likely transcribed this from source 2, as a close examination of the each will show that source 3 itself relies heavily on source 2. That 1827 is James' birth year is corroborated by multiple sources, and suggests his birth may have had something to do with his mother's death a few weeks later. And so, the cited genealogical entries can be updated accordingly:

- M iii [James Thomas Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/74905990/james-thomas-mills) was born on 13 Feb 1827 in New York City. He died 22 Apr 1915 in Huntington NY.

</div>

As he was then a child, presumably James moved with his family to Hempstead in the mid-1830's, where the Mills and the Pines attended Christ's First Presbyterian Church in Hempstead, and where the surname Watts can be found.

Several of James' children died in infancy, and were *re-buried* at Huntington Rural Cemetery on 22 May 1857:

<figure>
<blockquote>
One of the oldest "rural cemeteries" in Suffolk County, Huntington Rural Cemetery was established in 1853, during the "Rural Cemetery" movement of pre-Civil War America. ...As with many "rural cemeteries" across the country, burials from older family or farm cemeteries were moved to Huntington Rural Cemetery over the decades. Thus you will find dates long before 1853, some back into the 18th century, among the burials in this cemetery.

There is also a census entry for a daughter Cora M. born Jan 1871. This is Cora M. (Mills) Van Nostrand (Jan 1871 to 18 Oct 1908), sometimes written simply as "Cora Nostrand". Cora is listed in the *Index to the Huntington Rural Cemetery 1853-1990*. "She suffered greatly until death relieved her."

{{% fig "long-island/1908-10-20-Times-Union-Brooklyn-NY-p9" "500" /%}}

The first three names of possible heirs listed in the [Mills' home deeds]({{% relref "other-past-owners" %}}) from the time of Emily's death are the children of J. Thomas Mills:
  - Alonzo W. Mills (Jul 1858 to 09 May 1942) Sometimes spelled as Alonso.
  - George E. Mills (Feb 1856 to 10 Apr 1944). 
  - [Clarissa H. (Mills) Etsell](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/74907705/clarissa-h.-etsell) (Jun 1852 to Jan 1946). (Her name is misspelled as "Etsall" on the deeds, and elsewhere has been spelled "Edsall".)

At the time I am compiling this information, findagrave.com does not have entries for all the Mills in Huntington Rural Cemetery:

{{% fig "long-island/1853-1990-Index-To-The-Huntington-Rural-Cemetery" "800" /%}}

And the 1900 census is worth highlighting for the density of information it contains, including that J. Thomas and his sons George and Alonzo were all neighbors on Wall Street in Huntington:

{{% fig "long-island/1900-us-census-huntington-mills" "800" /%}}

Alonzo's daughter [Sarah (Mills) Reddy](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/215406844/sarah-reddy) (18 Jun 1883 to 02 Aug 1911) died in an accident very similar to Cora's a few years earlier. Understandably, Sarah's gravestone is inscribed “I have suffered”.

{{% fig "long-island/1911-08-02-The-Brooklyn-Daily-Eagle-Brooklyn-NY-p3" "500" /%}}

The "nine-months-old baby" was [Arthur A. Reddy](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/173810137/arthur-a-reddy) (05 Nov 1910 to 15 Nov 1937) who also died at a young age, leaving behind a small child:

</div>

The last name listed as a possible heir in the Mills' home deeds, Mary Huntting Smith, is likely a reference to Emily's cousin, or perhaps a descendent of Emily's cousin:
  - Edward's sister [Emily Tabitha (Mills) Huntting](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/23991494/emily-tabitha-huntting) (1821 to 1849) married [John Smith Huntting](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/23991462/john-smith-huntting) (1817 to 1893), 
  - their child [Mary Halliock (Huntting) Smith](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/24792330/mary-halliock-smith) (17 Jul 1845 to 1938), married [Henry Chatfield Smith](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/24792299/henry-chatfield-smith) (1843 to 1896),
  - their child [Mary Emily Huntting (Smith) Cross](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/24392636/mary-emily_huntting-cross) (1875 to 1924), married James M. Cross.

Several documents pertaining to Emily Tabitha (Mills) Huntting's marriage were included above. Emily T. and John Huntting had another daughter, [Emily Mills Huntting](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/23991552/emily-mills-huntting) (02 Apr 1849 to 1932), and her birth is presumably related to Emily T. Huntting's death nine days later. It appears to be Emily Mills Huntting who is referenced in the sales records of the [Mills' store]({{% relref "me-mills" %}}) as "Emily Huntting".

[Mary Emily Huntting (Smith) Cross](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/24392636/mary-emily_huntting-cross) (1875-1924) was yet another family member to die in "an unusual accident":

Edward's half-brother Robert appears to have lived most of his life in Hempstead, a married farmer. Note that Robert's birth year is generally given as 1835, although one obituary reports 1834. Robert's middle name is generally spelled with a "y", however it should be noted that the records of Christ's First Presbyterian Church at Hempstead consistently spell it with an "i" which may in fact be correct, as that is the spelling used by relative William Sidney Mount.

The Long Island Museum of American Art, History, & Carriages, owns many works of the artist [William Sidney Mount](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8123/william-sidney-mount) (26 Nov 1807 to 19 Nov 1868), who is another descendant of Timothy Mills and who is "generally considered the first major artist to paint the activities of everyday American life". In the mid-1800's, Mount painted many portraits, including members of the Mills family. 

<figure class="quote-only">
<blockquote>

According to Alfred Frankenstein's index of Mount's works, Mount painted the following Mills family members:</p>

  - Elizabeth Mills (1843) **This work is in our collection at LIM**

  - William Wickham Mills Esqr. (1829 & 1856)

  - Mrs. (Eliza Ann) William Wickham Mills (1855)

(William Wickham Mills' son [Horatio W. Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/68729755/horatio-w-mills) (21 Oct 1837 to 28 Jun 1880) died in [the Seawanhaka disaster]({{% relref "mills-samuel-wickham#the-seawanhaka-disaster" %}}).)

William Mount's [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sidney_Mount) shows a photograph of the artist taken by Mathew Brady, one of the earliest photographers in American history, famous for his photographs of the Civil War and prominent public figures. Mount also produced several self portraits in the collection of the Long Island Museum. The Metropolitan Museum of Art also houses many of Mount's paintings and sketches, and his works can be found in many other museum collections. More information on William Mount can be found [here]({{% relref "mount-william-sidney" %}}).

The Archives at Queens Library contains two boxes of materials of the "Mills Family of Jamaica and Mills Pond" that includes a reference to Jonas Mills in the scope notes, and talks of correspondence among the descendants of Timothy Mills in the 1870's (when Edward's family was in Corfu).

<h3>Historical Biographical Note</h3>
<p>This collection documents the Mills Family of Long Island. The family originated in Buffalo, New York and moved to Long Island in the 1800’s. Most of the information included in this collection was organized and collected by James H. Mills through correspondence with fellow family members and work done by B.F. Thompson. The collection contains several logs of Mills Family descendants and related families from other territories in America. There are also letters from Henry/Harry Mills dated from 1871-1874. Henry/Harry Mills seems to have done a lot of research on family history. The bulk of the collection focuses on the descendants of Timothy Mills an early settler of Mills Pond, Long Island.</p>

<h3>Scope And Content Note</h3>

<p>The Mills Family of Jamaica and Mills Pond, Long Island (2 boxes, 1675-1900) contains material documenting the genealogy of the Mills Family of Jamaica, Long Island. The collection is made up of letters and logs of Mills Family descendants. Research consists of various logs and lists of family members. There are also letters and listings of Mill Family members from other parts on the United States. This collection was donated to the Buffalo History Museum by Louise Olmsted, whose family were close friends of the Mills Family located in Buffalo. The collection was donated to the Queens Library Archives in August 2015. The original finding aid for this collection is included with this finding aid. A description of each folder’s contents is located within each folder of the collection. The Mills Family (19 folders, 1879-1895) series has been broken down by specific family members. The specific members are: Isaac Mills (5 folders, 1879-1893) Jonas Mills (1 folder, 1893) Jonathan Mills (3 folders, 1879-1895) Timothy Mills (10 folders, 1739-1896) The series for each contains information on various relatives for each member. The information includes spouses and children. The Research series (5 folders, 1675-1876) contains the forms and documents used for accumulating the history of the Mills Family. The other series in the collection Various Relatives (6 folders, 1636-1900) consists of material related to other relatives of the Mills Family that lived outside of the Jamaica and Long Island area.</p>

Of course, there are several Jonas Mills in the genealogy, but the dates given suggests this could be a reference to Edward's father. But even if this is a different branch of the Mills family, the genealogical records, etc., may provide important data on the family members investigated here.

The collection contains [nine portraits of family members]({{% relref "buffalo-mills" %}}), only two of which are explicitly identified, and all of which seem to be taken in photography studios in Buffalo. Queens Public Library obtained the portraits from the Buffalo History Museum. The Queens collection also contains a photocopy of a photo of the Mills home in Buffalo, and the original is presently still owned by the Buffalo History Museum:

<figure>
<blockquote>
<p>If I recall correctly, the photo of the house in Buffalo was the only thing we retained from the Mills family collection. Everything else, photos and papers, was transferred to Queens. 
<p>
</p>
However, we do have other loose photos of individuals in A-Z order by surname. I checked and these are the only people named Mills:
<p>
</p>
<ul>
  <li> John H. Mills, Company D, appears to be a Civil War soldier portrait.</li>
  <li> Edward M. Mills, ca. 1915. He is a young man in this photo, so he is not the Edward Mills who died in 1908.</li>
  <li> Robert Mills, ca. 1880, as an elderly man.</li>
  </ul>

After further investigation, to see if the 1880 Robert Mills could possibly be Edward H. Mills' half brother Robert Sydney Mills, I confirmed the photo is of [Robert Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/77507182/robert-mills) (unknown to 11 Dec 1890), an "Ex-Police Commissioner" and also "one of the most prominent builders and operators in lake vessels at this port", including one shipped named "Robert Mills" (11 Dec 1890, The Buffalo Commercial, Buffalo NY, p8). [More information on this Robert Mills here.]({{% relref "mills-robert" %}})

A document worth highlighting in the Queens collection is the will of Timothy Mills, the common ancestor. (A copy of his will can be found in the volume *A Documentary history of the family of Mills : descended from George Mills of Hempstead and Jamaica* by Lewis D. Cook.) And in addition to materials related to Buffalo,the inventory of the collection indicates there are Mills living in New Jersey, Ohio and Michigan, and intriguingly, Naples NY, possibly confirming a relation to the [Horace Mills]({{% relref "mills-horace-f-1854" %}}) of that region. The references to Buffalo and Naples may also provide context for the Mills' move to Corfu. 

The collection also contains genealogies and other information on the following surnames that can be found, often multiple times, throughout the Mills genealogy: 
  
  - Burnet
  - Davis
  - Halstead
  - Hawkins
  - Miller
  - Roe
  - Rudyard
  - Smith

Of particular interest is Hawkins: Hawkins is the maiden name of Bartlett Brown's mother, although I have not explored the genealogy well enough to make a definitive connection. (Bartlett Brown is described in [The Mills Family in Staten Island]({{% relref "staten-island" %}}).) William Mount's grandparents are [Jonas Hawkins](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/68728823/jonas-hawkins) (28 Aug 1752 to 24 Apr 1817) and [Ruth (Mills) Hawkins](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8844210/ruth-hawkins) (1748 to 22 Jan 1840), daughter of Jonathon Mills (28 Oct 1710 to 28 Oct 1798). During his childhood, William Mount lived for a time with his uncle Micah Hawkins (01 Jan 1777 to 29 Jul 1825), widely credited as "the author and composer of the first original American Opera", and who at one time "kept a grocery store in Catharine St. New York."

<figure class="quote-only">
<blockquote>
<p>
Micah Hawkins was a musical genius and could perform creditably upon the piano, flute or violin. He composed many songs and musical pieces which were published and proved to be popular. Several copies of original editions of these publications are still in possession of members of the family. He is best known however, as the author and composer of the first original American Opera, entitled "The Saw Mill," which had a satisfactory run at Henry Wallack's Chatham Theatre in New York city, during 1824. Besides his musical activities Micah Hawkins kept a grocery store in Catharine St. New York, in which was installed a piano and he was wont to regale his customers with a little music when they visited his shop.
</p>
<p>
He was a pleasant conversationalist, possessed a ready vein of wit and withal a good singer. It especially pleased him to sing his own songs which he did with great gusto. His portrait painted by Louis Child and retouched by his nephew William S. Mount, hangs in the Hawkins-Mount house at Stony Brook L. I. where he was born. It is said of him that he always wore a white cravat, which fact is attested by the portrait. Micah Hawkins was a close friend of Benjamin F. Thompson, the historian, who did much to encourage him in his musical efforts. For a further account of this interesting individual see Oscar Wegelin's "Micah Hawkins and The Saw Mill."
</p>
<p>
Of the printed edition of the "Saw Mill" only two copies are know to be in existence today, one belonging to Brown University and the other in the hands of a private collector. The book is therefore much sought after by collectors of Americana, particularly those interested in early drama.

According to information from an exhibition of William S. Mount's works at the Long Island Museum, Micah Hawkins had his piano specially built into the counter of the store he operated.

The portrait mentioned above:

</div> 

The image from The Frick Collection is a photographic reproduction of the painting taken around 1950, in other words, it represents the version of the portrait retouched by William Mount, and therefore, the version shown in *Genealogies of Long Island Families* must be the original portrait by Louis Child. According to The Frick Collection records, the painting was on loan from Suffolk Museum, Stony Brook, where it was part of their permanent collection. The Suffolk Museum was a previous name for The Long Island Museum in Stony Brook. 

There is also the following purported image of Micah Hawkins, found in *A Hawkins Genealogy 1635-1939* by Ralph Clymer Hawkins, Published by The Hawkins Association, which appears quite different still.

Based on a review of the Queens Public Library collection's inventory, it appears it may contain source information used in writing the following history:

{{% fig "long-island/1894-07-27-Port-Jervis-Union-Port-Jervis-NY-p3" "800x300" "" "top" /%}}
{{% fig "long-island/1894-07-28-Port-Jervis-Union-Port-Jervis-NY-p2" "800x300" "" "top" /%}}


These two articles were also re-printed as one item in the 02 Aug 1894 edition of the Tri-States Union in Port Jervis NY, p2, which I show here for purposes of comparing the text to the previous two articles.

Also note that James Harrison Mills of Buffalo was also researching the Mills family genealogy at approximately the same time:

<figure>
<blockquote>
This James Harrison Mills, a real estate and loan broker of 446 Main St., Buffalo, N.Y., compiled an extensive pedigree of the Mills Family, and corresponded on the subject in the years 1893-1895 with Mr. Thomas Morton Paton Mills of New York City on that subject. His letters and pedigree outlines, of which this present compilation is a review and amplification, are in the possession of the latter's daughter, Mrs. Robert B. Carnahan, Jr., The Croydon, N.Y.C., 1939.

Although I am still working my way through the Mills genealogy, it appears unlikely there are living descendants of Edward's parents, however, I am finding living descendants of Jonas and second wife Mary Platt Mills, in particular, there are descendants of Edward's half-brother Robert Sydney Mills who for a few generations have lived in Salt Lake City Utah and are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
