Edward Hallock Mills and Mary Ann Pine were married on 29 Dec 1850 in Hempstead NY by Reverend Nathaniel Clark Locke of the First Presbyterian Church of Hempstead. Reverend Locke deserves closer examination owing to several intriguing coincidences between his life and the Mills' that may provide context for the Mills' move to Corfu NY.

In 1837, 18 year old {{% pagelink "mills-edward-hallock-1819" %}} moved with his parents to an area in {{% pagelink "hempstead" "Hempstead" %}} known then as Trimming Square and today as Franklin Square. In Hempstead, Edward met his mentor in the grocery business, Charles M. Pine, and Charles' younger sister, Edward's first wife, [Mary Ann (Pine) Mills]({{% relref "mills-mary-ann-1819" %}}) (08 Feb 1819 to 28 Dec 1895). 

{{% fig "1882-02-10-The-Long-Islander-Huntington-NY-p3" "800" /%}}

Charles Pine's grocery store was established in 1848 in "Factoryville" an old, colloquial name for the neighborhood later called West New Brighton in Castleton, one of the original four towns of [Staten Island]({{% relref "staten-island" %}}). At least by 1850, Edward was living in Factoryville, presumably working in Pine's store, and possibly living in Pine's home next to the store, as other store clerks were known to do. 

Edward returned to Hempstead to marry Mary Ann Pine on 29 Dec 1850 at First Presbyterian Church, officiated by [Reverend Nathaniel Clark Locke](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/210515180/nathaniel-c-locke) (01 Jun 1815 to 21 Jul 1862).

Both the Mills and Pines attended Christ's First Presbyterian Church in Hempstead. Many other family names can be found in the Church's records that are either relatives of Mills and Pines or otherwise connected with them, including Seaman, Gildersleeve, Higbie, Weekes (also Weeks), Hawkins, Bedell and Mersereau. It is perhaps relevant that the surname "Watts" is also present and may provide context for understanding Edward's nephew's middle name (which he commonly went by).

<blockquote>
The history of Christ's First Presbyterian Church is closely identified with the history of Hempstead. In 1643, the Rev. Robert Fordham and John Carman found a suitable location for settlement here and purchased land from the Native Americans. Families came to settle the next year. They received a patent from the Dutch governor of the New Netherlands and the church was organized under Rev. Richard Denton. Rev. Denton had first settled in the Massachusetts May Colony, but left for Weathersfield, Connecticut in 1635 in order to practice Presbyterianism. Later, he and his followers came to Long Island for religious reasons. They established Christ's First Presbyterian Church in 1644. It is one of the oldest Presbyterian Churches in the country.

Reverend Locke had just moved to Hempstead from Brooklyn a few weeks prior to marrying the Mills, installed as pastor on 04 Dec 1850. He was remembered as "an able, discriminating, and impressive preacher, and gave evidence, wherever he was called to labor, of an honest and earnest devotion to the great work of the ministry." 

{{% fig "hempstead/nclocke" "800" /%}}

Edward and Mary Ann lived in West New Brighton throughout the 1850's, when each of their children were born, and one, {{% pagelink "mills-james-wheelock" "James" %}}, died. Based on tax assessment records from Corfu at the time, it seems that the Mills family moved from Staten Island to Corfu sometime between Sept 1862, when Edward's store is not listed and May 1863, when Edward's store is listed:

{{% fig "tax-assessments/1863-05-01-District-29-Division-12" "350" /%}}
</div>

Note the following:

  - The Mills' move to Corfu is likely only a few months after the death of Reverend Locke.
  - Despite living for many years in Hempstead where he died, Reverend Locke is buried in Batavia NY, exactly 13 miles (according to Google Maps) from Evergreen Hill Cemetery in Corfu NY, where Edward and Mary Ann are buried.

These facts strike me, although at the moment, I can't claim these are more than coincidences, and perhaps even that reaches. Still, this seems worthy of further exploration, beginning with understanding why Reverend Locke is buried in Batavia, a place to which he does not appear to have any previous relationship. 

Furthermore, the Reverend's only surviving daughter at the time, [Fanny Spencer Locke, 2nd](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8113448/fanny-spencer-locke) (1860 to 16 Jul 1862) predeceased him by merely a week, and his father, [Dr. John Locke](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/210514773/john-locke) (1784 to 01 Aug 1862) died two weeks after him. (Fanny was the older sister of [Fanny Smith Locke](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8113260/fanny-smith-locke) (1854 to 06 Jun 1855).

First, an examination of Reverend Locke's life, and family, beginning with his parents:

## Camera Lucida

[TODO: backlinks from staten island, hempstead, etc.]

The mystery of Reverend Nathaniel Clark Locke deepened when he seemed to reappear in an unexpected place. As I was researching the family of Charles M. and Elmira (Loper) Pine of {{% pagelink "staten-island#milton-lopers-civil-war-letters" "Staten Island" %}}, I began corresponding with Martha Deed, who I later learned is a distant cousin of mine, and she educated me about Elmira's family, the Lopers. When she offered a photograph of Elmira's father Luther Loper, I was shocked to see a very familiar face, shown in the following high resolution scan of the original print artifact (600 DPI of 8x10 original) provided by the Huntington Historical Society, where Martha had donated the photograph:

{{% fig "hempstead/locke/comparisons/grandfather-front" "800" /%}}

For clarity, I enhanced the contrast, then grayscaled.

{{% fig "hempstead/locke/comparisons/grandfather-enhanced" "800" /%}}
{{% fig "hempstead/locke/comparisons/grandfather-enhanced-gray" "800" /%}}

The Huntington Historical Society was also generous enough to provide a high resolution scan of the back of the photograph as well, which provides the identification.

{{% fig "hempstead/locke/comparisons/grandfather-back" "800" /%}}

{{% fig "hempstead/locke/comparisons/grandfather-back-id" "800" /%}}

The lower handwriting is obviously "modern", and the attribution to Juliett Loper Shepard is confirmed by Martha Deed, who has transcribed many examples of Juliett's handwritten letters.  [TODO: can she provide an example well suited for comparison?]

But I recognize the man as Reverend Nathaniel Clark Locke, as he is shown in the "Souvenir" book image:

{{% fig "hempstead/nclocke" "800" /%}}

{{% fig "hempstead/locke/comparisons/sidexsidephotos" "800" /%}}

As the following records show, Luther Loper appears to have been a relatively "well-to-do" farmer, and he was likely wealthier than Reverend Locke, despite the prestige of the Reverend's position. Luther's real estate was valued at $5,000 in the 1850 census, and that same year, Reverend Locke is still living in Brooklyn on 13 Aug, with no real estate listed. Luther lived in Hempstead for many years before his death, and he was a member of Hempstead Presbyterian Church when Reverend Locke became its pastor, and Reverend Locke was still pastor when Luther died, presumably officiating his funeral.

For convenience, I will refer to the purported photograph of Luther Loper as the **Grandfather** photograph, and the purported image of Reverend Locke, the **Souvenir** image. 

As I continue this exploration, I will make the following assumptions:

  1. The two images are of the same man, captured in two different exposures in the same sitting.
  2. At least one of the attributions is correct. In other words, I am not considering the possibility that both images are mis-identified.

I believe it is quite evident this is the same man, photographed on the same day. Among the many similarities, the clearest include: 

  - The hair is quite distinctive: side parted and slicked over, the sides are swept forward over the cheeks, and the hair is gathered around the base of his skull. There is also a "widow's peak".
  - The facial hair is "Amish style", a beard without a mustache, a style President Abraham Lincoln would adopt after his 1860 election.
  - The shirt collar is turned up, and there is a rounded set of ruffles in the front. The jacket has a two-tone collar. 

But which identification is correct? First, let's recognize two facts working in our favor for identification: 

  1. Luther Loper and Reverend Locke were not close in age, so if either photograph can be dated, the correct identification should be clearly evident.
  2. Despite their age difference, the two men died relatively close in time, greatly helping to constrain the date range of the photograph, assuming one identification is correct.

<figure>

| Name | Birth | Death | Age at Death |
| ---- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Luther Loper | 1780-06-04 | 1856-04-05 | 75 | 
| N.C. Locke | 1815-06-01 | 1862-07-21 | 47 | 

</figure>

I began by reflecting on the hair and beard style, which seems relatively modern, and various aspects of the style of clothing. Most notably, the upturned collar struck me as a style that might indicate a member of the clergy.

<figure>

> In the 1850s, that kind of collar was common for non-clerical men to wear. It doesn't look like a reverend's collar in particular, but I would consult texts on 19th-century men's clothing to be sure.

In the Grandfather Photo, we also see the gentleman holding a book. I speculated if this was a bible, a prop intended to symbolize the man's profession?

<figure>

> It was also very common for photographic sitters to hold all types of books. Sometimes a Bible but in other instances any regular book or even a photographic album, which is easily mistaken for a book. So it's hard to say with any certainty what is in his lap. I can't make out the piece of hardware near his lap. Again, consulting a book or other expert on mid-19th-century men's fashion may be useful here.

Another intriguing aspect of the Grandfather photo is that his eyes appear to have been manually outlined.

{{% fig "hempstead/locke/comparisons/eyes-closeup" "800" /%}}

<figure>

> As for the outline on the eyes, that looks like someone drew on the photographic print after the fact to make the eyes more prominent. This could have been done many years later or at the time of its production, as was very common at the time. It would have been a way to supplement the fuzziness of a salt print with more defined edges or where more detail was wanted.

Looking at the Souvenir photograph, the shirt collar and ruffles are more pronounced than in the other images, and if the original artifact is ever located, it would be interesting to examine it to see if these had been manually enhanced afterward in a similar way.

Turning to the medium of the Grandfather photograph itself, it is clearly a paper-based print, as abundantly evident from the damaged edge of the scanned print:

{{% fig "hempstead/locke/comparisons/edges" "500" /%}}

Prior to 1860 in America, the primary commercial paper-based print photographic processes were calotypes, and later, albumen prints, **both of which were produced from negatives, so that the photographs could be reproduced**, as opposed to Daguerrotypes, for example, which were unique positives. (I believe it is plainly evident this is not a cyanotype.) It appears that the popularity of calotypes in America was waning just as the popularity of albumin prints was rising, and becoming widespread by the mid-1850's. (1980, James M. Reilly, *The Albumen & Salted Paper Book: The History and Practice of Photographic Printing, 1840-1895*, Rochester NY, p28.)

One aspect that struck me when I originally examined the Souvenir photograph was the fuzzy, indistinct nature of it, almost more like a realistic painting than a photograph. Lower clarity of detail is a key defining characteristic of caloptypes, whereas albumen prints had greater clarity of detail and contrast.

<figure>

>
> William Henry Fox Talbot patented a photographic process in 1841 that led to a stable negative image. The process involves exposing a sheet of sensitized paper in the camera then developing, fixing, and washing it. The stable negative image could be contact printed.
>
> Though calotypes are soft and hazy, with visible paper fibers, the invention revolutionized image-making by making it possible to produce multiple prints from one negative image. It was also used as a means of making copies of drawings and documents. The process remained in use through the 1850s, when it was replaced by the albumen silver print.

</figure>

In James Reilly's authoritative book on the subject, he notes that albumen prints are characterized by a "smooth, glossy surface" from the egg white coating uniformly filling the paper's pores. (Ibid., p24.) He contrasts this to calotypes, that have a "distinctly fibrous texture" due to the natural grain of the paper being visible. (Ibid., p14.) 

<figure>

> The calotype, which is also known as a salted paper print or salt print, is distinct from other forms of paper photography in that the photographic material (the darkened areas of the picture that make up the photograph) is actually embedded into the paper itself. This gives this type of print a "fuzzy" quality that is distinct from something like an albumen photograph, where the photographic material is suspended in a layer of albumen (egg whites) on top of the paper, which gives that process a sharper image.

Looking at the closeup of a portion of Grandfather photograph, the paper texture is clearly visible:

{{% fig "hempstead/locke/paper-grain" "800" /%}}

A simple search of New York newspapers (on nyshistoricnewspapers.org) between 1840 and 1860 for "calotype" finds mentions of the process beginning with a Watertown advertisement on 17 Oct 1849, and, starting 19 Jul 1850 and ending 28 Nov 1851, advertisements run in Elmira which comprise the bulk of mentions. In each of these cases, they are advertising supplies and equipment related to the process. A similar advertisement can be found in Rochester on 22 Jan 1852. The use of the calotype process by photographers is suggested in a New York Evening Post article on 28 Nov 1851, and the latest reference to its use can be found in Penn-Yan on 02 Apr 1856, where it appears to be part of a general discussion of photographic processes of the time.   

<figure>

> I'm not comfortable making a definitive ID from the digital snapshot, but it looks like it could be a candidate for a salted paper print. One of my photography colleagues recommended looking at the print under raking light (you can use your phone flashlight holding it over the print at 90 to 45 degrees). If you see a shiny surface, then you have an albumen print. If not, it's most likely salted paper/calotype.

Michelle Smiley from the Library of Congress referred me to GraphicAtlas.org which has detailed information on identifying calotypes. Compare this description of fading due to silver oxidation against the original scan of the grandfather photograph: 

<div class="cols">
<figure style="max-width: 350px;"> 

> Oxidation appears as fading and change in image tone toward yellow-brown; this occurs first in highlights where there is less silver; in books and albums, **fading tends to occur from the edges into the center of the print. Sulfiding appears as an overall warm, yellow-brown color.**

Next, compare the following description of image tones and colors against the version of the grandfather photograph in which only the contrast was digitally adjusted:

<div class="cols">
<figure style="max-width: 350px;"> 

> Warm image tones ranging from reddish brown to purple or yellowish are an identifying feature of salted paper prints as well as other printed out prints. Small, photolytic silver image particles are formed by the action of ultraviolet light on the light sensitive silver chloride crystals. **Photolytic silver yields a warm, reddish, color. Therefore early, un-toned prints are a red or red-brown.** Sulfur and gold toning were regularly used to give prints a brown or purple-brown hue. The final print color is dependent on paper and sizing type, print exposure, toner formula, and length of time in the toning bath. **Common deterioration such as foxing, fading, yellowing, and loss of highlight detail will alter the image tone.**

(TODO: Is it valid to compare a physical description against a digitally enhanced scanned photograph?)


"Foxing is an age-related process of deterioration that causes spots and browning on paper documents..." ([Foxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxing), Wikipedia.org). The Souvenir photograph, used for the publication when the photograph was approximately four decades old, appears to show spots when magnified, most pronounced against the dark collar I might add, although these apparent defects could have other explanations. The much older Grandfather photograph doesn't show the same defects, but of course, the prints could have been produced at different times with varying qualities of papers and chemical solutions. The Grandfather photograph appears to show variations in paper thickness and resulting absorption of the coating, perhaps most apparent around his face and extending vertically in the contrast enhanced grayscaled version presented above.  

</figure>

I believe the Grandfather photograph was a calotype/salted paper print, and by extension, so was the artifact used for the Souvenir image. This constrains the timeframe for the date of the photograph to the early 1840's on the extreme low end to Reverend Locke's death on the high end, as that also encompasses Luther Loper's death. In a moment, I will try to demonstrate that the likely date of the photographs can be further constrained to a few years in the late 1840's and early 1850's, the timeframe when Reverend Locke left his Brooklyn ministry for Hempstead, possibly providing the motivation for the photographs.

But whether a calotype or albumen print, clearly we know the Grandfather photograph was created from a negative, meaning potentially other positive prints still exist, even if hidden from sight presently. Moreover, if I am correct that this is the same man in the same sitting for both the Grandfather and Souvenir photos, then there was obviously more than one negative created as well, increasing the likelihood of finding more corroborating prints in the future. In fact, I will provide evidence momentarily that there were at least three negatives created from that sitting.

Presently, I am in contact with Huntington Historical Society to try to arrange for an expert to make a definitive identification of the photographic process used for the Grandfather photograph.

I have also contacted Christ's First Presbyterian Church and they could not find the original artifact used for the Souvenir photograph, nor could they find any other photographs for illustrations of Reverend Locke. (17 Oct 2024, Luci Duckson-Bramble, Christ's First Presbyterian Church, Hempstead NY, personal correspondence.) I am attempting to contact a Hempstead historian to search for similar corroborating photographs of Reverend Locke.

I have also contacted the Presbyterian Historical Society and they were unable to find any photographs of Reverend Locke. (12 Mar 2024, Sonia Prescott, Reference and Outreach Archivist, Presbyterian Historical Society, personal correspondence.) I am also reaching out to Locke descendants on Ancestry.com who have Reverend Locke in their family trees to potentially find corroborating photographs.

There is another intriguing data point to consider: in the Locke family genealogy *Book of the Lockes: A Genealogical and Historical Record of the Descendants of William Locke, of Woburn.* by John Goodwin Locke, there is an *illustration* of Reverend Locke, that I will hereafter reference as "**Illustration**":

{{% fig "hempstead/locke/book-of-lockes-p294b" "800" /%}}

There are striking similarities between the Illustration, Grandfather, and Souvenir photographs, including the widows peak, the hair swept forward over the ears, the Amish style beard, the upturned shirt collar with rounded ruffles in front. And of course, all the strong facial features and the penetrating gaze appear to match.

{{% fig "hempstead/locke/comparisons/allthreehorizontalcomparison" "800" /%}}

The main visual difference I can see between the Illustration and both the Grandfather and Souvenir photographs is that the jacket collar is a uniform color and material in the Illustration. However, I believe that this is simply a decision made by the artist in the process of converting a photograph into an illustration, which I will explore in more detail momentarily. For now, it is simply enough to acknowledge that reproducing the jacket collar faithfully would take away time better spent on facial details and would in fact be a visual distraction from the facial details.

I wanted to further explore the similarities between the  Grandfather photograph and the Illustration, and decided to use a method of comparing photographs I had employed in the {{% pagelink "buffalo-mills" %}} section. Despite the fact that I was comparing a photograph and an illustration, that they came from very different sources, and that the faces are oriented differently, the comparison was surprisingly illuminating.  

My basic method is to ensure proper scale by initially aligning pupils between two image: I start with one of the images as my base, and put a copy of the second image to the right and below the first, and scale the second image until pupils align both vertically and horizontally. I then copy the base image to the bottom right, so the pupils align. By creating an alternating 2x2 matrix of pairs of the images being compared, I not only make direct comparisons in a static environment more convenient, but it also visually proves that the paired copies are at the same scale, and so, the viewer is not in danger of being misled by comparing images at different scales. I then draw perfectly straight vertical or horizontal lines to see if any other facial features align, if the heads are the same shape and proportion, etc., ultimately creating a grid distinct to those images, that can be used to judge similarity.

In the Buffalo Mills comparison, I was able to align and scale the photographs for proper comparison based on aligning both sets of pupils, based on my manual estimation. Because the faces in Grandfather and Illustration are oriented differently, I am not able to scale based on two reference points. As it turns out, this is not necessary. In the comparisons that follow, understand that I am using the images extracted from their scanned sources at the same resolution, and **at their original scale**. I just so happens that **both Grandfather and Illustration are at the same exact scale**, and I will attempt to explain why.

{{% fig "hempstead/locke/comparisons/sidexside" "800" /%}}

For purposes of alignment only, I chose each subject's left eye (on the right side of the photograph as viewed):

{{% fig "hempstead/locke/comparisons/fullsquarecompare-initial" "800" /%}}

Already I will point out a compelling aspect of the images, the very slight upward placement of the right eye relative to the left. Now, a grid that highlights the edges of the features already identified as common to each image as well as other important facial features: 

{{% fig "hempstead/locke/comparisons/fullsquarecompare" "800" /%}}

To my surprise, the Grandfather photograph, identified as Luther Loper, and the Illustration of Reverend Locke, taken from different sources at their original scales, appear to match closely, and where they differ, it is exactly where and how you would expect them to differ based solely on the fact that the faces are oriented to the camera differently. This suggests to me that the Illustration was based on another exposure of Reverend Locke taken in the same sitting as the Grandfather photograph, with Locke turning slightly to his left in each subsequent exposure, and it would appear to the same degree between each of the three known images, starting with Grandfather, then Illustration, then Souvenir:  

{{% fig "hempstead/locke/comparisons/allthreehorizontalcomparison" "800" /%}}

I believe I can provide a valid narrative explanation for the origin of the Illustration that fits the known facts presented, but I must stress that what follows is my *conjecture* as to what actually occurred. 

First, understand that the *Book of the Lockes* (hereafter: BotL) was published in Reverend Locke's lifetime (and Luther Loper's): 1853, and in the forward, “To My Kinsfolk”, John Locke wrote on 01 Jan 1853 that “seven years of labor are over…I hope the time spent has not been entirely in vain…” (BotL, p5.) 

Having examined a number of family genealogies, including their source material, I have seen many response letters to inquiries from the compilers of those genealogies. During this timeframe, there were well established postal routes between Boston where John Locke lived and the greater New York City area where Reverend Locke lived. John Locke knew of, or came to know of Reverend Locke, and it was presumably the Reverend himself who responded to an inquiry letter from John Locke, likely confirming or correcting purported information, offering updates, and providing his own brief biography and a photograph. This would have happened after Reverend Locke moved to Hempstead, as his biography in BotL references his 04 Dec 1850 installation over Christ's First Presbyterian Church.  

The Illustration is a woodcut. In 1853, the technology to reproduce a photograph in a printed book or magazine involved using various tools and techniques to draw the image on a block of wood that would then be used as a guide for an engraver to carve the image into the wood surface. The engraved woodblock was then inked and printed using a relief press, similar to the printing of type at the time. (See 1974, Estelle Jussim, Visual Communication and the Graphic Arts: Photographic Technologies in the Nineteenth Century, R.R. Bowker Company, NY.)

<figure>

> Woodcut is a relief printing technique in printmaking. An artist carves an image into the surface of a block of wood—typically with gouges—leaving the printing parts level with the surface while removing the non-printing parts. Areas that the artist cuts away carry no ink, while characters or images at surface level carry the ink to produce the print. The block is cut along the wood grain (unlike wood engraving, where the block is cut in the end-grain). The surface is covered with ink by rolling over the surface with an ink-covered roller (brayer), leaving ink upon the flat surface but not in the non-printing areas.

But how do we account for the apparent high degree of precision between Grandfather and Illustration? There were a few tools and techniques that could have been employed at that time to accomplish this, including an inexpensive and readily available tool at that time, the *camera lucida*: 

<figure>

> A *camera lucida* is an optical device used as a drawing aid by artists and microscopists. It projects an optical superimposition of the subject being viewed onto the surface upon which the artist is drawing. The artist sees both scene and drawing surface simultaneously, as in a photographic double exposure. This allows the artist to duplicate key points of the scene on the drawing surface, thus aiding in the accurate rendering of perspective. ...The *camera lucida* was patented in 1806 by the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston.

<figcaption>
<cite>

— [Camera lucida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_lucida), Wikipedia.org

</cite>

<aside>

  - Wikipedia further notes: "While on honeymoon in Italy in 1833, the photographic pioneer William Fox Talbot used a camera lucida as a sketching aid. He later wrote that it was a disappointment with his resulting efforts which encouraged him to seek a means to "cause these natural images to imprint themselves durably"." (Ibid.) Talbot later invented the calotype photographic process.

</aside>
</figcaption>
</figure>

Note the role the camera lucida played in motivating the creation of the calotype process.

But the fact that the Illustration is that same scale as the Grandfather photograph seems to be a clue that suggests that a more direct method of applying the photograph to the woodblock for tracing was employed.

<figure>

> From its inception, photography could contribute a great deal to the creation of wood engravings such as this. Photographs could, most simply, serve as sources for illustrations, so that the artist who drew the image onto the woodblock could work from something other than a drawing or memory or the imagination. This was especially appealing for illustrations that needed to be appreciated for their accuracy, such as a portrait or any other picture that promised to deliver more information with closer scrutiny. By the 1850s it was not unusual to see wood-engraved illustrations cited as being “from” or “after” a photograph—such as one titled Grouse on Nest from the same Scribner’ article as the Davis engravings—claiming something of the veracity of photography even if the illustrations themselves really looked nothing like photographs (fig. 3). 
>
> That same decade saw the development of a new and much more direct use of photography in wood engraving. In a technique sometimes called “photoxylography,” whatever picture was to be engraved could be photographically printed directly onto the woodblock, freeing up artists to work in whatever medium they wished and removing the need for an intervening draughtsman.

There are also identifying marks on the Illustration, the most prominent:

A similar mark from another illustration in BotL is clearer:

{{% fig "hempstead/locke/comparisons/better-studio" "500" /%}}

This identifies the engraver as John William Orr, "one of the best known wood engravers of his generation." (1958, Sinclair Hamilton, Early American Book Illustrators and Wood Engravers 1670-1870, Princeton University Press, Archive.org.) As a result, the woodcuts in BotL have their own cultural significance apart from their inclusion in the Locke genealogy.

<figure>

> John William Orr (1815–1887) commonly known as J. W. Orr, was an Irish-born American wood engraver who drew many of his own illustrations and owned his own engraving and printing business. He was born in Ireland on March 31, 1815, and was brought to Buffalo, New York in his infancy. In 1836, he completed his instruction in drawing and engraving in New York City under the distinguished William Redfield. He returned to Buffalo, where he practiced wood-engraving and published several illustrated books, including *Orr's Pictorial Guide to Niagara Falls* (1842), for which he designed and engraved the illustrations. He went to Albany, New York in 1842 as artist and engraver for *The Country Gentleman* and while there was awarded a gold medal for the best engravings of animals. In 1844 he settled in New York City, where his first employment was on Harper Brothers' *Illustrated Shakespeare*. It was not long before he had his own business, a wood-engraving and printing establishment at 75 and 77 Nassau Street, New York. An advertisement of around 1857 states that he specialized in "illustrated catalogues and ornamental show cards", and manufactured "illuminated envelopes". His son, Louis Herbert Orr, was a successful typographer.

</figure>

A city directory of the time states that J. W. Orr's engraving business "is the largest establishment of the kind in the City". (1855, John F. Trow, Trow's New York City Directory, p639, archive.org.) Nassau Street is the Financial District of Manhattan, and in the 1850's was known for its book stores, particularly used and rare books. 

{{% fig "hempstead/locke/orr-ad2" "800" /%}}

The following advertisement for Orr's firm in *The Literary World*, which was printed at nearby 109 Nassau Street, is adjacent to "publisher and bookseller" James Munroe & Co. of Boston, the publisher of *Book of the Lockes*.  

{{% fig "hempstead/locke/orr-ad" "800" /%}}

James Munroe is himself a Locke descendant, and is recorded as entry 747, p240, *Book of the Lockes*. 

It should also be noted that John Orr worked with his younger brother Nathaniel from 1844 to 1846, and Nathaniel Orr advertised his engraving firm on p14 of the same issue of *The Literary World*, its location was on 151 Fulton Street. In Wilson's Business Directory of New York City in 1853, Nathaniel's firm is located at 52 John Street. (John F. Trow, Printer and Publisher.) Many books of wood engravings by both men are owned by Princeton University Library and the University of Florida George A. Smathers Libraries Special and Area Studies Collections. 



It may also be relevant to point out that I have seen two different scanned versions of *Book of the Lockes*, that have the same publication date, and as far as I can tell from a cursory inspection, the only apparent difference between them is a change in the author's woodcut, and the addition of one for his wife. Although the publication date is the same, I think we can reasonably assume that John Locke would have updated the book to add his wife, not remove her! The relevant information on Reverend Locke for example, appears unchanged, however, be aware there are potentially other editions of the book that may not be obvious. 

John Locke's wife Jane was a published poet of some renown. Her maiden name is *Starkweather*, and John and Jane did spend two years in Buffalo in the early 1830's. J. W. Orr's family lived in Buffalo at this time, although Orr may have been studying in New York City at this precise time. (I have reached out to Corfu Village Historian Allan Starkweather to see if he is a descendant of Jane's family.)

The Illustration also has another identifier that the other woodcuts in BotL do not have:

{{% fig "hempstead/locke/comparisons/illus-sig" "500" /%}}


First, I am presuming that the intended initials are "SW" and not "WS" given the relative size of the letters and that fact that the smaller "S" is drawn over the "W".


Only "engravers" and not anything that could potentially be closely related, such as "draughtsman".

Age vs resemblance. 

TODO: An alternate strategy to consider: look for known calotypes that are in collections related to Brooklyn or Hempstead, or of subjects related to Brooklyn or Hempstead, and then look for known date and photographer of those items.

 Edward Nichols mentioned in Mersereau assault


I propose a theory that may explain the awkwardness: I believe the intended date was 1854, not 1864. This would fit quite naturally with the other known data points of Edward Nichols' activities in Western New York, and I think the error can easily be explained as either a simple mis-transcription error, as a 5 and 6, especially handwritten, could be easily mistaken one for the other, or an equally simple "neighbor error": at the time of this article, the newspaper may have been manually typeset using physical metal type pieces in assembled lines, or it may have used a Linotype machine, utilizing a keyboard to set the metal type *more quickly* . In either case, even if the typesetter intended to select a 5, he could have easily made the simple mistake of selecting a neighboring character instead. So, at the very least, I think there is substantial room for skepticism of the accuracy of the 1864 date.
