Edward Hallock Mills, born 25 Mar 1819, Smithtown NY, died 01 Jan 1908 Brookton, NY. Patriarch of the Mills family. Co-owner of [E. H. Mills & Co.]({{% relref "corfu" %}}) general store in Corfu NY and owner of [E. H. Mills]({{% relref "me-mills" %}}) in Motts Corners/Brookton NY.

That Edward was born in Smithtown NY is corroborated by two sources explored further below: Edward's marriage registration to Hannah in Caroline, and his obituary in the notes of Brookton Congregational Church. The 1875 New York State census only specifies Long Island as his birthplace. Generally speaking, whenever Smithtown is referenced in relation to the Mills, it is quite likely referring specifically to [Mills Pond]({{% relref "smithtown" %}}). 

The family's whereabouts in 1827 are given in the obituary of Edward's younger brother, James Thomas Mills:

<figure>
<blockquote>
Mr. [James Thomas] Mills was not born in Suffolk County, but he was only two weeks and two days old when he first came to old Suffolk. He first saw the light of day at Cherry street, New York City, February 13, 1827. He was the son of Jonas D. Mills and Mary Hallock, a Smithtown woman, and before he was three weeks old, his parents came up to Smithtown on a large sailing vessel, to make their home.

The Mills' return to Smithtown, "two weeks and two days" after James' birth on 13 Feb 1827, was 01 Mar, the day before James' and Edward's mother Mary (Hallock) purportedly died (according to only one source, now defunct, MillsAncestry.org), and just a few weeks before Edward's eighth birthday. 

(The precise day of Mary (Hallock) Mills' death is given in only one of [the three known Mills genealogies]({{% relref "smithtown" %}}), and although it can also be found in a number of user created family trees on Ancestry.com, I have not found one that cites a source for it. I have not yet found documentation independently corroborating this day in my own research.)


25 Apr 1831, Edward's father Jonas married Mary Platt (Mills) Mills, whose parents were also members of Smithtown Presbyterian. 

{{% fig "genealogy/smithtown-presbyterian/46" "800" /%}}

The ceremony was conducted by [Reverend Ithamar Pillsbury](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/54257823/ithamar-pillsbury) (22 Aug 1794 to 20 Apr 1862), who was a veteran of the War of 1812, and was witnessed by [Benjamin Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/23873051/benjamin-mills) (21 Jul 1791 to 31 Jul 1886), Mary Platt's brother, and Elizabeth Mills, Mary Platt's sister, as Mary Platt's mother Elizabeth died in either 1826 or 1828, depending on the source used. Further down the page, Jonas and Mary Platt are witnesses to Benjamin Mills' marriage to his third wife, [Charity (Smith) Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/23873106/charity-mills) (25 Feb 1799 to 14 Oct 1870). 

At the time of his marriage to Mary Platt, Jonas lists his occupation as "carpenter" and in his obituary, it is said that "in his young days he learned the wheelwright trade, which at that time included the undertaking business." (10 Feb 1882, The Long-Islander, Huntington NY, p3, nyshistoricnewspapers.org.) 

<figure>
<blockquote>
<p>
A wheelwright is a craftsman who builds or repairs wooden wheels. The word is the combination of "wheel" and the word "wright", (which comes from the Old English word "wryhta", meaning a worker or shaper of wood) as in shipwright and arkwright. This occupational name became the English surname Wright. It also appears in surnames like Cartwright and Wainwright. It corresponds with skilful metal workers being called Smith.
</p>
<p>
These tradesmen made wheels for carts (cartwheels), wagons (wains), traps and coaches and the belt drives of steam powered machinery. They also made the wheels, and often the frames, for spinning wheels for home use. First constructing the hub (called the nave), the spokes and the rim segments called felloes, (pronounced fell low), and assembling them all into a unit working from the center of the wheel outwards. Most wheels were made from wood, but other materials have been used, such as bone and horn, for decorative or other purposes.

Ten years later, when Edward was approximately 18 years old, the Mills family moved to Hempstead NY, according to Jonas' obituary. (10 Feb 1882, The Long-Islander, Huntington NY, p3, nyshistoricnewspapers.org.) It appears likely that Edward followed the rest of the family to Hempstead, as it is noted in the Hempstead Sentinel that Edward lived there at one time.

Jonas and Mary Platt Mills' first child Sarah died a few years prior to the family's move to Hempstead, when she was only a year and a half old.  When the family arrived in Hempstead, their second child Robert was just a few years old.  

In the 1840 census in Hempstead, several related names are found, including Seaman, Rhodes, Bedell, and specifically, Luther Loper, Samuel Pine and Jonas Mills, Edward's father: 

{{% fig "long-island/1840-United-States-Federal-Census-Hempstead-NY" "800" /%}}

Hempstead is also referred to historically as South Hempstead, and was part of Queens County before the creation of Nassau County, which then became its designated county. 

<figure>
<blockquote>
<p>If Hempstead were to be incorporated as a city, it would be the second-largest city in New York, behind New York City; it is about three times the size of Buffalo, which has long been the state's second-largest city. ...Hempstead is thus the most populous municipality in the New York metropolitan area outside New York City.
</p>
<p>
...During the American Revolution, the Loyalists in the south and the American sympathizers in the north caused a split in 1784 into "North Hempstead" and "South Hempstead". With the 1898 incorporation of the Borough of Queens as part of the city of New York, and the 1899 split of Queens County to create Nassau County, some southwestern portions of the Town of Hempstead seceded from the town and became part of the Borough of Queens.

For Edward to move to Hempstead as a young man fits with other known facts and greatly adds to our understanding not only of his early adulthood, but the rest of his life. In Hempstead, Edward met two very important residents: Mary Ann Pine, who became Edward's first wife and mother of Emily Mills, and Mary Ann's brother, Charles M. Pine, who became Edward's employer and mentor in the grocery business.
 
A few years prior to the Mills' move to Hempstead, Charles M. Pine was already living there, a newly married co-proprietor of the general store Weekes, Seaman & Pine. Hempstead was presumably when Edward's and Charles' paths first crossed, and it would seem likely that Edward may have initially worked at Weekes, Seaman & Pine. To understand Edward's life, one must understand the life of Charles Pine, which Edward emulated in many ways.  

{{% fig "staten-island/1835-02-21-charles-pine" "700" /%}}

On 14 Dec 1843, Edward's sister [Emily Tabitha (Mills) Huntting](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/23991494/emily-tabitha-huntting) (19 Jun 1821 to 11 Apr 1849) married [John Smith Huntting](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/23991462/john-smith-huntting) (12 Dec 1817 to 21 Nov 1893) in Smithtown. They were members of Smithtown Presbyterian where their three children were baptized. Emily died nine days after giving birth to [Emily Mills Huntting](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/23991552/emily-mills-huntting) (02 Apr 1849 to 1932). I believe it is Emily Mills Huntting who appears to be referenced in the sales records of the [Mills' store]({{% relref "me-mills" %}}) as "Emily Huntting".  

Jonas' obituary, shown further below, noted that he lived in Hempstead "with the exception of a few years", which included 1850, where he is recorded in the United States Federal Census in Islip NY, at age 55, a "farmer". The family appears to return to Smithtown by 1851, when Mary Platt is readmitted to Smithtown Presbyterian on 03 Jan 1851 and then returns to Hempstead as evidenced by her removal from the church, "by certificate to Hempstead" 05 Jun 1858.

In 1850, Edward was living in [Factoryville (West New Brighton) Staten Island]({{% relref "staten-island" %}}), and he married his first wife [Mary Ann Pine (1819-1895)]({{% relref "mills-mary-ann-1819" %}}) in Hempstead. Charles Pine's grocery store in Staten Island was established in 1848, likely narrowing the timeframe for when Edward moved to Factoryville.

{{% fig "hempstead/NY-gbr-p256" "500" /%}}

All of the Mills children were born in Staten Island, and by 1860, the family was living with another of Charles Pine's proteges, Barlett Brown, in a home adjoining a general store Bartlett had recently purchased. 

A more complete exploration of the family's time in Staten Island can be found at {{% pagelink "staten-island" %}}.

The family arrived in [Corfu NY]({{% relref "corfu" %}}) sometime between 01 Sept 1862 and 01 May 1863. Partnering with Charles Pine, Edward co-owned [E. H. Mills & Co.]({{% relref "corfu" %}}) "cash store" in Corfu, "Dealers in General Merchandise, Groceries and Provisions, Yankee Notions and General Variety Store." Of Edward’s children, there is only evidence that Horace clerked at his father’s store.

{{% fig "1863-edward-civil-war-draft" "800" /%}}

[Horace]({{% relref "mills-horace-f-1854" %}}) committed suicide in Corfu in Oct 1876.

In Mar 1879, Edward, then 60, moved his family again, this time to Motts Corners, an earlier name for Brooktondale. At Motts Corners, Edward restarted his grocery and dry goods business on his own as [E. H. Mills]({{% relref "me-mills" %}}). Both [Jonas]({{% relref "mills-jonas-e-1852" %}}) and [Emily]({{% relref "mills-mary-emily-1858" %}}) clerked for their father. 

Edward's father Jonas died in 1882.

Edward's son Jonas died after a brief illness in Oct 1885.

Edward's obituary mentions that he was "postmaster during the Cleveland administration" which I can confirm refers to the first Cleveland administration from 1885 to 1889. (As I write this, Cleveland is the only president to have two non-consecutive terms.) A partial list of Brooktondale postmasters from usps.com, beginning with the very first, up to the 1970's:

Mary Ann died on the eve of their 45th wedding anniversary. One year and two days later, Edward married [Hannah (Thatcher) Eastman (1824-1917)]({{% relref "mills-hannah-1824" %}}). Edward and Hannah joined Brookton Congregational Church on just the third to last Sunday before their marriage ceremony, which took place "at the bride's residence in Brookton".

## Notes for Future Researchers


There is an Edward H. Mills and a corresponding E. H. Mills & Co. in Gloversville NY in the 1880's that was a "knitting factory" and one that is written about in some detail in local historical accounts. I have not investigated this family very much beyond ruling them out as the subjects of my research.

{{% fig "1882-gloversville-directory-p85" "800" /%}}
{{% fig "1886-gloversville-directory-p77" "800" /%}}

The members of the Gloversville Mills family can just barely be made out in the 1875 New York State Census in Fulton County:

Edward Hallock's family are accounted for in the same census in Genesee County:
