Frank,

The second half of the locust tree in the middle of Proto Park fell at exactly 2:25 PM on Friday, August 5. I heard it, but by the time I got to the window to look, it was already down. I was sure that it would take down the power lines when it fell, we were very lucky! I took photos of the immediate aftermath if you are interested.

Here is some information about a few of the past owners of The Old Postoffice and of particular interest, George E. Sanders, who was one of the charter members of the Caroline Masonic Lodge.

The following information is either currently on my website in a different form, or it will be at some point in the future: memills.com .

## Summary

Edward and Amanda (Sanders) Lounsbery are former owners of both "the old postoffice"/Mills' Store and my home, where the Mills family lived. The second floor of the building was known as "Lounsbery Hall" where groups like the Good Templars met, and events such as plays were held. Edward Lounsbery purchased the property from George **E.** Sanders, his wife Amanda's brother. George's father, George **T.** Sanders was the proprietor of the general store in the building immediately before the Mills took it over and it became known as E. H. Mills & Co. Later, the property would be inherited by Amanda's sister Libbie (Sanders) Peck, and she would sell it to Dr. Lockwood.

**Both George E. Sanders and Libbie's husband George R. Peck were Masons. George E. Sanders was a charter member.**

## Detail

A partial summary of Mills' store deeds that I have been able to discover:

{{% autotable "/static/data/deeds.csv" "mills-store-deeds" "book,book-num-i,page-num-i,document-date-d-nw,recorded-date-d-nw,grantor,grantee" "484 Brooktondale Road, Brooktondale NY, Tompkins County Clerk, Ithaca NY." "property" "=" "Mills Store" /%}}

Although George **E.** Sanders legally owned the property, it is his father, George **Townley** Sanders who ran the general store on the first floor. 

By the late 1860’s, Josiah Shurter’s properties (including the lower grist mill/Dalebrook parcel) were taken over by his son, [Willis Shurter](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/162159964/willis_shurter) (1840 to 17 Jan 1914). On 16 May 1868, "Willis Shurter and Jane Shurter his wife" sell the store property to [George E. Sanders](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338797/george-e-sanders) (16 Aug 1847 to 01 Nov 1889), and two years later in the 1870 United States Federal Census for Caroline, George E. Sanders is listed in the census as "clerk in store" while George's father, [George Townley Sanders](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338795/george-townley-sanders) (14 Nov 1818 to 04 May 1887) is listed as a "dealer in dry goods & groceries (ret)", in his son's building.

George T. Sanders married [Lurana Maria “Maria” (Nicholas) Sanders](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338796/lurana_maria_sanders) (30 Oct 1820 to 13 Jan 1884), and they, along with daughter and son-in-law, Amanda (Sanders) and Edward Lounsbery, were founding members of the [Congregational Church of Mott's Corners]({{% relref "founding-documents" %}}) in 1868, now called Caroline Valley Community Church. George T. Sanders was also Brookton postmaster from 20 Jul 1861 to 15 Dec 1864, succeeded by Walker V. Personius.

The 1866 Atlas labels the store property as "J. Shurter Store" and indicates it is managed by [Edward C. Marsh](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/28741041/edward-c-marsh) (23 Nov 1836 to 25 Jun 1907), a Civil War veteran and Josiah Shurter's son-in-law, married to Harriet "Hattie" (Shurter) Marsh (1848? to 10 Apr 1917) and living in the "Shurter House", the home of Josiah Shurter, which at that time was located between the store building and Six Mile Creek. Edward Marsh is also listed in the census with occupations such as "miller" (presumably in the lower grist mill, owned at one time by the Shurter family) and "carpenter" possibly working in "Willis Shurter's Wagon Shop in Mott's Corners" which was located in what was later known as the "Brewer Barn", the rough wood building that still exists today as part of the Lockwood property, having been transferred by Jessie Brewer to the Wells' in the decades past. Edward Marsh appears to have been involved in the construction of my home, as his name is carved in a stone on the front of my foundation:

Edward and Harriet later moved to Ithaca, and Edward became a respected city constable.

On 12 Oct 1874, "George E. Sanders and Fannie his wife" ([Frances "Fannie" (Webster) Sanders](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338798/fannie-sanders) (23 Nov 1847 to 10 Feb 1896)) sell the store property to George's brother-in-law, [Edward Lounsbery](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338793/edward-lounsbery) (11 Oct 1833 to 27 Nov 1904), and a few months later in the 1875 census, George E. Sanders' occupation is "tanner" presumably working with Edward: when [Franklin Cuthbert Cornell Sr.](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/172201621/franklin-cuthbert-cornell) (28 Aug 1837 to 22 Jan 1908), the eldest son of [Ezra Cornell](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/233/ezra_cornell) (11 Jan 1807 to 09 Dec 1874), the founder of Cornell University, sold the upper grist mill property to George Campbell, Caroline Deeds book 3, page 550, 21 May 1881, a "piece of land" was reserved for Edward and his brother-in-law, [George E. Sanders](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338797/george_e_sanders) (16 Aug 1847 to 01 Nov 1889), which seems to corroborate a Carl English painting displayed in the Caroline History Room that refers to a tannery near the upper mill, although the deeds only refer to it as a "factory". George E.'s obituary states that he was also a produce dealer at one time.

The following two photos show George E. Sanders at different stages of his life:

It appears George E.'s father, George Townley Sanders, continues to operate the store for several years after the transfer from his son to his son-in-law, as evidenced by the following news item discussing the temperance group {{% pagelink "good-templars" %}}, of which George Townley Sanders' family, including daughter [Amanda (Sanders) Lounsbery](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338794/amanda-lounsbery) (12 Oct 1842 to 13 Nov 1921) and her husband Edward, were members.

A few years later in March 1879, Edward Mills arrives in Mott's Corners and takes over operation of the store shortly thereafter. The 1880 United States Federal Census for Caroline shows Edward is a "merchant" and his son Jonas is a "clerk in store".

Correspondingly in 1880, George T. Sanders and wife Maria are living in Cortland with their daughter [Sarah F. (Sanders) Edwards](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338800/sarah-f-edwards) (09 Oct 1840 to 10 May 1896), who married [Nelson G. Edwards](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338799/nelson_g_edwards) (01 Aug 1835 to 21 Nov 1920).  George T. listed his occupation as “retired merchant”, and he lived the rest of his life in Cortland.

Edward Mills' surviving children Jonas and Emily clerk in their father's store, and they also both become members of High Bridge Lodge of the Good Templars shortly after arriving in Mott's Corners. Mills' store is indirectly mentioned in the High Bridge Lodge meeting minutes notebook On 20 Feb 1885: "Worthy Chief and two girls retired to the store for refreshments." (Tompkins County History Center, Ithaca NY.) After Edward's death New Year's Day 1908, Emily continues to run the store as M. E. Mills until her death in 1937.

[Edward Lounsbery](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338793/edward-lounsbery) (11 Oct 1833 to 27 Nov 1904) was a tanner and currier, a Civil War veteran, and a founding member of the David Ireland Post #158 in Brookton, which originally organized in Lounsbery Hall, over the store:

Edward entered the 179th New York Infantry Regiment, Company B as a private on 31 Aug 1864 and was promoted to First Lieutenant on 11 Dec 1864. Edward's Company, "Co B was at surender [sic] of Lee". Company B also included Frederick Elmer Bates (04 May 1842 to 04 Jan 1922), briefly a part owner of the lower grist mill/Dalebrook, Nelson J. Edwards, John James Roe, John Ault, and Dan C. Hanford, among others from Caroline.

Davis, ancestry.com.)

(It is Fred E. Bates whose initials "F.E.B." are carved in Dalebrook's foundation, which dates the foundation to his brief ownership after a fire in the early 1890's. Fred Bates was a Civil War veteran and member of the David Ireland Post of the GAR. He was a successful businessman of Brookton, and served on the Board of Supervisors of the Town of Caroline in 1896 and 1897. He married Reverend Juanita (Breckenridge) Bates (31 Dec 1860 to 11 Jun 1946), one of the three early women ministers of the Congregational/Federated/Community church in Brooktondale, and Fred Bates later moved to Ithaca, eventually becoming Mayor.)

Both Edward and his wife [Amanda (Sanders) Lounsbery](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338794/amanda-lounsbery) (12 Oct 1842 to 13 Nov 1921) were founding members of the {{% pagelink "founding-documents" "Congregational Church of Mott's Corners" %}}, known today as Caroline Valley Community Church.

Caroline Valley Community Church records show that Edward was present at the "informal meeting" on 05 Mar 1868 at the home of Walker V. Personius that Church's organization on 12 Mar 1868, when Edward, along with his wife Amanda, are listed as charter members. It is noted in the Church's meeting minutes that at the 05 Mar meeting "on motion of Edward Lounsbery Mr. William Personeus was chosen chairman and Walker V. Personius secretary." Edward died within the Congregational Church while addressing the Christian Endeavor Society.

Edward and Amanda Lounsbery were founders and leaders of the {{% pagelink "good-templars" "Independent Order of Good Templars Lodges" %}} and the Sons of Temperance organizations in Mott's Corners. The Good Templars met in Lounsbery Hall. Edward was also politically active in the Prohibition Party.

As one of Edward's obituary's states, Edward's tannery was known at one time as "Lounsbery & Peck", the Peck presumably being his co-brother-in-law, [George Riley Peck](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/20462930/george-riley-peck) (14 May 1851 to 28 Nov 1916) who married Edward's wife Amanda's sister [Elizabeth "Libbie" H. (Sanders) Peck](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/138388479/libbie_h_peck) (05 Nov 1857 to 04 Nov 1929) on 28 Feb 1877 in Brookton NY. After Amanda (Sanders) Lounsbery's death, Mills' store passed to Amanda's sister Libbie (Sanders) Peck.

In 1925, Libbie Peck sells the Mills' store property, now known as M. E. Mills, to [Dr. Benjamin Franklin Lockwood](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/97943230/benjamin-franklin-lockwood) (01 Mar 1862 to 15 May 1934). For a few months, the Lockwoods lived in the space formerly known as Lounsbery Hall, where the Good Templars met, and the GAR was formed.
