Ellen Jane (Andrews) Predmore Gould, born 27 Mar 1848 Bourne, Lincolnshire, England, died 31 Oct 1929 Ithaca NY. Ellen lived in the Mills' home, possibly for over a decade, to help care for Hannah and to help Emily with the home and store. She was a devoted member of Brookton Baptist Church and active in the temperance movement.

For my immediate purposes here, I will focus initially on the period of Ellen's life that intersects with the Mills family, and fill in more detail later.

The following historical research comes from a direct descendent of Ellen Gould:

<figure class="quote-only">
<blockquote>
<p>Ellen Jane Andrews (1848-1929) was born in Bourne, Lincolnshire, England as were both of her parents. And her parents were married in Bourne.</p>

<p>…Ellen Jane Andrews (age 3) arrived with her parents Joseph (age 27) and Ellen Pell Andrews (25) and Charlotte (infant) on 6/21/1851 in NYC. The passenger and Crew List (including Castle Garden and Ellis Island) 1820-1957 is found in Ancestry.com. Also on the passenger list is Henry Pell (age 50) and his wife Ellen Newton (age 50). Ellen Jane's maternal grandparents. And two of Ellen Pell Andrews siblings Sarah (age 19) and James (age 17). Of the 760 names on the passenger list of the Western World that sailed from Liverpool, England I do not find any other Andrews. So I think Joseph and Ellen Pell Andrews were sailing with Ellen's parents. Joseph and Ellen Newton Pell both died in the 1880 in Howell, Michigan.</p>

<p>…There was a Andrews family in Ithaca but it appears to not be our Ellen Jane Andrews parents.</p>

In the 1892 census, Ellen Gould, listed as Ellen J. Predmore, is apparently living in Brookton with her family, surrounded by many recognizable names. She married Alfred Gould in 1893. Alfred Gould worked on the railroad at Brookton Depot alongside George H. Richardson's father and Jerome Miller's father John.

The first (presumed) mention of Ellen in connection to the Mills family is an entry made by Emily in the sales journal of <a href="{{% relref "me-mills" %}}"> E. H. Mills general store</a>: "1908, Jan 23, Sewing by Mrs. Gould, 0.75".

It isn't clear when exactly Ellen started living in the Mills' home, but she may have lived there roughly a decade, or possibly a dozen years. In late 1914, when Ellen is first mentioned in the "gossip columns" in relation to the Mills, Ellen had been widowed a second time, and it is in the final few years of Hannah's life. Ellen was getting older herself, and this arrangement not only helped Emily care for Hannah, but also provided Ellen with additional social and financial support. It had the added benefit of being a short walk from both the Baptist Church, and her son Myron Predmore's farm, located near Brookton Depot, in the area where the gravel pit is presently.

Like Hannah and Emily, Ellen was active in the Women's Christian Temperance Union. Both Hannah and Ellen were born in England, and Ellen at least, spoke with an English accent. This fact suggests the possibility that Hannah herself spoke with an English accent, but at the very least, Ellen's familiar voice surely added comfort. Ellen's temperament also sounds like it was very compatible with what we know of Hannah and Emily:

<blockquote>
My mother was born in 1916 and had only two memories of Ellen. That she was very proper and spoke with an English accent.

In Gertrude Conant's recollections, she makes reference to Ellen and her relationship with Emily in the years after Hannah's death:

<blockquote style="max-width: 800px">[Emily] had a woman who lived in and kept house for and cooked the meals, and would stay in the store while she ate lunch and supper. I can't remember her name, but she looked a great deal like Miss Mills.</blockquote>

However, as the following reporting suggests, the relationship between Emily and Ellen seems considerably more than that of employer and employee. As Emily, Hannah and Ellen were members of the W.C.T.U. at that time, they were very likely well acquainted before Ellen moved in, and, as previously stated, it appears Ellen may have lived with Emily for a decade or more during which every major area of their lives seemed to have been intertwined, including many temperance and prayer meetings in the home. Ellen helped with both the home and store, and she and Emily also socialized together, although I don't know how regularly. The women were only a decade apart in age, and it seems they had a great deal in common.

According to reporting at the time, sometime later in 1926 or early in 1927, Ellen moved out of the Mills' home to live with her family for the last few years of her life. It looks as though she may have spent a significant amount of time at her son Myron Predmore's home before finally settling with her daughter Clara. Ellen is mentioned often in the "gossip columns" during that time, but these are some of the more telling reports as to where she was living:

Although she had repeated boughts of illness, Ellen appears to have been active to the end:

Ellen is [interred](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/35944445/ellen-jane-predmore) at Seneca Union Cemetery, Valois NY.

On 24 Oct 2022, Ellen's great-great granddaughter, Carol Coggshall visited Brooktondale for the first time, on one of her regular return visits to New York to research her family history. I suggested that a summary of her visit may be of interest to any future readers, and she replied: "Feel free to add a summary of our visit. And mention what a wonderful tour guide you are."

We met for lunch at Brookton's Market (Mulk's Store) where Carol gave a "show and tell" of her family tree, photographs of several of the ancestors, and diaries that I noticed had several similarities to George Jansen's. 

We then went on a walking tour of the immediate vicinity, and I told what I knew of the following landmarks:
  
  - Brookon's Market (Mulk's store),

  - the former location of the Shurter House, and a rough description of how the road once ran, and the orientation of the previous "lower bridge" before the road improvement that necessitated moving the Shurter House, 

  - "the old postoffice" (Mills' store, where Ellen was known to work),

  - Dalebrook Apartments (the old grist mill), and I pointed out the location of the mill pond and the course of the mill race,

  - I also pointed out Dr. Lockwood's home, Mulk's home, and the meat market on the same side of the street as Mills' store, 

  - Mills' home, including the approximate location of the mill race bridge, as well as a rough idea of the course of the Brookton trestle which would have been clearly visible from both Mills' store and Mills' home.

We then drove around to see the following:

  - the present location of the Shurter House,

  - the gravel pit, where Brookton Depot (and one end of the Brookton trestle) and Myron Predmore's farm once stood,

  - Cooper Cemetery, where members of the Gould, Predmore and Kenyon families are buried,

  - the former location of the Baptist Church, which Ellen attended, 

  - we drove by Quick/Brookton Cemetery but didn't stop,

  - Garrett Mandeville/Old Dutch Reformed Cemetery, which Carol remembered visiting some years before, where members of the Genung family are buried.

We then drove by the current location of the Baptist Church on Route 79/Slaterville Road and the former location of Besemer Station at the other end of the Brookton trestle.

Another detail I thought worth noting: Carol decided it would be appropriate to order the sandwich "Carol's Medley" for lunch at the Market. From the Brookton's Market menu:

> **Carol’s Medley**
>
> Your CHOICE OF turkey or ham with provolone cheese, tomato, cucumber, apple slices, & Dijon
>
> $11.99
>
> Served on your CHOICE OF wrap or bread: multigrain, rye, sourdough, white, or French peasant(GF options extra $0.75). Served HOT or COLD specified to your liking.

If memory serves, Carol chose turkey and French peasant--the bread choice recommended by the staff as the best option. Carol later wrote: "Sandwich and cookie were both delicious."

The sandwiches are named for past employees who worked in the store after it became Brookton's Market in Fall 2007, while I was in the process of purchasing Mills' home. Carol's Medley is named for Carol Bone, an original co-manager at that time:

{{% fig "ellen-gould/2007-11-20-The-Ithaca-Journal-Ithaca-NY-p4" "500" /%}}

In 2011, during a time that Carol was still co-manager, Brookton's Market created and published a [calendar]({{% relref "2011-calendar-brooktons-market" %}}) with significant historical details as well as current photographs. Carol Bone has since moved out of the area, although I still occasionally see her in the Market on her return visits to Brooktondale. 
## Notes for Future Researchers

In Gertrude Conant's recollections, she notes that Ellen Gould "looked a great deal like Miss Mills," so when looking for photos of either woman, one must be cautious not to mis-identify one for the other. And so, I have also been trying to find confirmed photos of Ellen, but after the usual inquiries and reaching out to her descendants, it seems that as with Emily, there are currently no known photos of Ellen.
