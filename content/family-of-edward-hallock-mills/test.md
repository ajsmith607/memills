templars, supreme being, emily's possible membership in church. Yes Horace, but not necessarily needed, as it was attractive as social club, and this was an opportunity for Emily to quickly integrate to new surroundings. However, there is also the WCTU later as a sign of committment. This and church baptism may simply be indication of growing reliance on community support as family died, and she was living alone. (1917 is when Hannah died.)

> A postmark is a postal marking made on an envelope, parcel, postcard or the like, indicating the place, date and time that the item was delivered into the care of a postal service, or sometimes indicating where and when received or in transit. Modern postmarks are often applied simultaneously with **the cancellation or killer** that marks postage stamps as having been used. Sometimes a postmark alone is used to cancel stamps, and the two terms are often used interchangeably.

> Before Rural Free Delivery, people had to walk or hitch up a horse and drive at least a few miles to a post office to mail letters or to receive them. While each hamlet, it might seem, had it post office and general store, often the latter housed the former, "Going to town" to shop, pick up and send mail, and run similar errands was usually a weekly or fortnightly chore. It could consume a half day or more, and was not a particularly casual affair.

> Today it is difficult to envision the isolation and loneliness that were the lot of the farmer and his family in early America. The typical farm family had no telephone (the telephone was patented in 1877 but wasn't in general use until much later); no automobile (Henry Ford wasn't born until 1863; his company wasn't organized until 1903); there were no radios, no TVs.
>
> The farmer's only links to the outside world were the mail and the newspapers which came by mail to the nearest post office. Since the mail had to be picked up, this meant a trip to the post office, often involving a day in travel. The farmer often delayed picking up his mail for days, weeks, or even months until the trip could be coupled with one for supplies, food, or equipment.

1885: “Queer Customs in China”

Also, I found something that might be what you're looking for? Here's the citation: KATE, A. (1856, May 08). THE COUNTRY STORE. New York Observer and Chronicle (1833-1912), 34, 1. https://www.proquest.com/magazines/country-store/docview/136603348/se-2

First lines: "I went one day into a country store to make some purchases. Although a large and flourishing establishment, it had nothing remarkable to distinguish it from other stores in the village. It contained the usual complement of dry goods, groceries, and farming utensils, with a large display of white crockery, rolls of carpeting, both rag and ingrain, gay colored oil cloth, and a variety of brooms and brushes of all sorts and sizes."

I don't think this newspaper is in NYS Historic Newspapers, which might explain why it hadn't turned up for you. It was apparently a Presbyterian publication from downstate, which tracks with the other appearances being in churches: https://www.loc.gov/item/sn93063786/

I can send you the PDF if you'd like! It's about, basically, a shopkeeper who stocks and gives away religious tracts for children, and how important it is to encourage moral and religious growth. Signed "Aunt Kate," which might explain the lack of author...

Although it is not mentioned in his obituaries, Dick was an avid philatlist, "one who collects or studies stamps" (Merriam-Webster), and he wrote authoritatively on the subject.  

<figure>

> This book is a memorial to Royden H. Lounsbery, one of the early members of ESPHS [Empire State Postal History Society]. After he joined in 1967 Mr. Lounsbery (Dick, as he was known to his friends) was an active member of the Society. He contributed articles to both the __Excelsior__ and the __Bulletin__. The article, “Enfield Centre Shield” in Vol I No 1 1971, and the history of the “Cayuga and Susquehanna RR” in Vol I No 2 1972 __Excelsior__ are both outstanding. Dick was very supportive of Empire State auctions, both buying and selling. He is a great loss to Empire State and to Philately in general, and will be long remembered by those of us who had the privilege of sharing his expertise, knowledge and, most of all, friendship. One of his interests was cancels, and he had many of the unusual ones in his collection.

Perhaps Dick’s interest in philately can be traced to his grandfather, [Frederick Barnard ("Fred") Lounsbery](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100072846/frederick-barnard-lounsbery) (03 Mar 1855 to 18 Jul 1933) who was Brookton postmaster from 19 Nov 1897 to 19 Jun 1933, during the years that the postoffice was located in Mulks' Store, presently Brookton's Market next to Dalebrook. It was during this time that Rural Free Delivery in Brooktondale began [date] 

Fred Lounsbery's uncle was Edward Lounsbery, the Civil War veteran and tanner who owned both Mills' Store and the property at 475 Brooktondale road, the Mills' Place, for some of the time that Edward Mills' family lived there. Edward Lounsbery is discussed in a number of areas of this work including in relation to the Brookton Lodge of the temperance organization the Independent Order of Good Templars, the Brookton GAR, and the Congregational Church, all of which he was instrumental in founding.

Edward Lounsbery and George Peck were both "dealers in hides" and operated a tannery, Lounsbery & Peck, next to Walker V. Personius' store at present-day 559 Brooktondale Road. 

Like Mills' and Mulks' Stores, Personius' had to contend with theft.

The real estate listing I responded to indicated the home was built in 1865, and while I can’t verify this in anything else I have seen, this is probably a good guess, as this coincides with William Wolcott leaving the battlefields of the Civil War, mustering out a few weeks prior to the 1865 census, although the initial deed for the property, which bears his name, is not created until 1869.

50th Engineer Regiment. "MANDERVILLE , JOHN H.—Age, 21 years. Enlisted, September 6, 1861, at Caroline; mustered in as corporal, Co. G, September 6, 1861, to serve three years; discharged for disability, January 4, 1862, at Washington, D. C." Despite the spelling difference here, which is correct in the corresponding muster roll, I believe there is enough corroborating evidence to make this identification. Although his grave stone states he was in Company A, both the unit roster and muster roll show that "John H. Mandeville" of Caroline was mustered in by the leader of Company G, Captain Walker V. Personius on 06 Sep 1861 in Elmira NY. There is no corresponding Mandeville in Company A, and the only other Mandeville listed in either the muster roll or unit roster for the 50th Volunteer Engineers was John Mandeville's uncle, [James Dewitt Henry Mandeville](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/65245834/james-henry-mandeville) (1804 to 1889), who was also in Company G.







The New York General Assembly was not ready for the good-roads legislation, and would not be until 1898 when it passed the Higbie-Armstrong Good Roads Bill, named after Senator Higbie and Senator William W. Armstrong of Rochester. It established a State-aid approach under which the State would pay half the cost of projects to improve town and county roads.

(Authentication as a civil war era belt buckle)

Ira Middaugh lived in Caroline, Danby and Ithaca, but was born in Tioga County. In Candor NY on 27 Aug 1862, at 18 years old, Ira enlisted as a private in Company H of the 137th Infantry Regiment. He mustered in one week later, 27 Aug 1862. He mustered out on 09 Jun 1865 in Bladensburg, MA, the same date and location as William Wolcott. 

(ira middaugh in descriptive book)

company size:


<figure>

> On the Union side units comprised of “regular” soldiers—those established in the armed forces before the Civil War and which bore a “U.S.” designation—or “volunteer” soldiers—those which consisted of men serving in state-based units that were typically created specifically for the Civil War. ...
>
> The majority of servicemen during the Civil War joined the infantry. Infantrymen were foot soldiers who wielded muskets and whose officers carried swords and pistols. Upon enlistment, infantrymen typically joined companies, usually comprised of men from the same town or county or part of a state. On paper, companies were supposed to contain 100 men. In practice, due primarily to enlistment issues, illness, casualties, and desertion, they often consisted of closer to 30-50 men. Within each company, the soldiers were further divided into platoons and squads. Each company was usually under the command of a captain, who was assisted by a first lieutenant and a second lieutenant.[2] At first, companies had text-based names like the Columbus Rifles or the Mifflin Guards, for example, but after they were further organized they would be assigned a company alphabetic letter, such as “Company G.”
>
> Companies were grouped together to form regiments—the fighting unit with which soldiers most identified. The regiment was the basic maneuver unit of the Civil War. Regiments could consist of just a few companies or as many as fourteen, but ten was the official number—ten companies of 100 men meant that regiments, on paper, were composed of 1,000 officers and men. Yet because of undersized companies, especially as the war progressed the average Civil War regiment at mid-war consisted of 300-500 soldiers. Volunteer regiments were denoted by numbers followed by the state they represented, for example, the 99th Pennsylvania or the 7th South Carolina. Regiments were ideally commanded by colonels (the “commanding officer”) who oversaw two field officers—the lieutenant colonel and the major—and 30 “line” officers: ten captains and twenty lieutenants, who were in charge of the companies. A few more officers might work on the colonel’s staff as adjutants and aides. Noncommissioned officers—sergeant majors, sergeants and corporals—were also responsible for company-level duties.

Here is a list of popular periodicals from 1860 to 1875 in America, including general interest publications as well as those aimed primarily at women. Many of these would contain religious-themed poetry, essays, and other content:

General Interest Periodicals:
Harper's Weekly
A widely read general interest magazine that featured news, literature, poetry, and art. It often included religious and moral reflections.

The Atlantic Monthly
A literary and cultural magazine, publishing poetry, essays, and fiction. Many prominent authors of the time, including religious writers, were featured here.

Scribner's Monthly
Known for literature and essays, this magazine often included poetry with spiritual or moral themes. It was later renamed "The Century Magazine."

The Independent
A weekly periodical that combined politics, literature, and religion. It was popular with a Protestant audience and often included religious poetry and articles.

The Christian Advocate
A Methodist Episcopal publication focusing on religious news, articles, and poetry. It was widely read by religious communities across America.

The North American Review
A more academic and intellectual periodical that published essays, poetry, and critiques. Though less religiously focused, it occasionally featured content with spiritual themes.

Littell's Living Age
A literary magazine that reprinted articles, poetry, and essays from British and American publications, often including religious content.

Periodicals Aimed Primarily at Women:

Godey's Lady's Book
One of the most popular women's magazines of the time, featuring fashion, household advice, and literature, including religious and moral poetry.

Peterson's Magazine
Similar to Godey’s, this magazine included fiction, poetry, and advice for women. It often featured religious or moral poetry as part of its literary content.

The Ladies' Repository
A Methodist monthly magazine aimed at women, it was known for religious essays, poetry, and articles on domestic life. It had a clear Christian focus.

The Lily
A women's temperance journal, which also included poetry and moral essays. Though more focused on social issues, it often reflected religious themes.

Arthur's Home Magazine
Aimed at women and families, this magazine included moral stories and religious poetry, along with practical household tips.

The Woman’s Journal
A feminist publication that discussed women’s rights but also included religious reflections and poetry with spiritual themes.
These periodicals would be excellent sources for finding religious-themed poetry and content reflective of the time’s spiritual and moral concerns. They were accessible to a broad readership and reflect the variety of religious and secular interests prevalent in American society during the period.

Hempstead, NY 11550

Blessings,

I am doing personal historical research that includes Christ's First Presbyterian Church, and in particular, your pastor from 1850 to 1860, Reverend Dr. Nathaniel Clark Locke (1815 to 21 Jul 1862), most often written as N. C. Locke. 

Could someone knowledgeable of the Church's history contact me, for what is likely to be a brief exchange, to help me identify a photograph that I believe shows the Reverend?  

The photograph I have appears to match Reverend Locke's image as shown between pages 6 and 7 of the booklet "Souvenir of the 250th Anniversary of Christ's First Presbyterian Church" available on the Church's website. A cropped version of that image is attached.

I would like to know if the original artifact used for the Souvenir booklet still exists? Also, are there any other known photographs or likenesses of Reverend Locke? And in general, I would be interested in any other biographical information about the Reverend that you may be willing to share.

I am publishing my research on my personal, non-commercial website at memills.com. The Hempstead page contains some information on Reverend Locke.

Please accept the small token that accompanies this message in appreciation of your Christian service.

May His grace and peace be with you,



Adam Smith

Quaddressing is a simple, minimal addressing system in two dimensional space. To specify an area within an artifact with ever increasing precision, starting with "0" which is generally implied, as it essentially refers to the entire artifact (technically it refers to the minimum bounding box of the artifact), the artifact is recursively divided into quarters, so that with each iteration, each previously divided quarter is divided into quarters, and each quarter is numbered left-to-right, top-to-bottom, and the quarter number of the target area is recorded for each iteration of divisions. So, for example "4" refers to the lower right hand quarter, "44" is closer to that corner, but "411" is closer to the center. There is no theoretical upper limit to the number of iterations allowed. The final value is called a "quaddress".

Quaddressing is applicable to many digital and physical artifacts that are two dimensional in nature, such as photographs, paintings, maps, manuscript pages, etc. Quaddressing can be applied at any scale and even with objects of irregular shape. The notation is minimal and adaptable, able to be optimized for a given object and its context. And its simple algorithm allows easy reading and recording by human actors as well as code. 

Quaddresses solved a problem I encountered in research sessions, when I would download many newspaper page images, and upon returning to them later for further processing, I was wasting time scanning the images again for the relatively small amount of text I needed. Quaddresses allowed me to quickly encode this information in a downloaded image's filename so that when I was viewing it later, I could quickly focus on the target area. Its simple notation was easy to record with each object and use in citations later.
