Another daughter of George T. Sanders, [Libbie H. (Sanders) Peck](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/138388479/libbie-h-peck) (05 Nov 1857 to 04 Nov 1929), married [George Riley Peck](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/20462930/george-riley-peck) (14 May 1851 to 28 Nov 1916) in 1877. Edward Lounsbery and George Peck were both "dealers in hides" and operated a tannery, Lounsbery & Peck, next to Walker V. Personius' store at present-day 559 Brooktondale Road. 

Like Mills' and Mulks' Stores, Personius' had to contend with theft.

The real estate listing I responded to indicated the home was built in 1865, and while I can’t verify this in anything else I have seen, this is probably a good guess, as this coincides with William Wolcott leaving the battlefields of the Civil War, mustering out a few weeks prior to the 1865 census, although the initial deed for the property, which bears his name, is not created until 1869.

50th Engineer Regiment. "MANDERVILLE , JOHN H.—Age, 21 years. Enlisted, September 6, 1861, at Caroline; mustered in as corporal, Co. G, September 6, 1861, to serve three years; discharged for disability, January 4, 1862, at Washington, D. C." Despite the spelling difference here, which is correct in the corresponding muster roll, I believe there is enough corroborating evidence to make this identification. Although his grave stone states he was in Company A, both the unit roster and muster roll show that "John H. Mandeville" of Caroline was mustered in by the leader of Company G, Captain Walker V. Personius on 06 Sep 1861 in Elmira NY. There is no corresponding Mandeville in Company A, and the only other Mandeville listed in either the muster roll or unit roster for the 50th Volunteer Engineers was John Mandeville's uncle, [James Dewitt Henry Mandeville](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/65245834/james-henry-mandeville) (1804 to 1889), who was also in Company G.







The New York General Assembly was not ready for the good-roads legislation, and would not be until 1898 when it passed the Higbie-Armstrong Good Roads Bill, named after Senator Higbie and Senator William W. Armstrong of Rochester. It established a State-aid approach under which the State would pay half the cost of projects to improve town and county roads.

> Six Mile Creek rises in Dryden, flows southwest through Slaterville and Brookton, thence northwest through Ithaca, uniting with the Inlet at the foot of State street. The only considerable waterfall upon it is known as Wells Falls, situated inside the city limits, but the valley of the stream above abounds with deep gorges and wild, impressive scenery.

In the North, the Union had the industrial resources and was able to die-stamp as many as a million of these buckles. Consequently, the US Oval is not terribly valuable...

(Authentication as a civil war era belt buckle)

Ira Middaugh lived in Caroline, Danby and Ithaca, but was born in Tioga County. In Candor NY on 27 Aug 1862, at 18 years old, Ira enlisted as a private in Company H of the 137th Infantry Regiment. He mustered in one week later, 27 Aug 1862. He mustered out on 09 Jun 1865 in Bladensburg, MA, the same date and location as William Wolcott.

> On the Union side units comprised of “regular” soldiers—those established in the armed forces before the Civil War and which bore a “U.S.” designation—or “volunteer” soldiers—those which consisted of men serving in state-based units that were typically created specifically for the Civil War. ...
>
> The majority of servicemen during the Civil War joined the infantry. Infantrymen were foot soldiers who wielded muskets and whose officers carried swords and pistols. Upon enlistment, infantrymen typically joined companies, usually comprised of men from the same town or county or part of a state. On paper, companies were supposed to contain 100 men. In practice, due primarily to enlistment issues, illness, casualties, and desertion, they often consisted of closer to 30-50 men. Within each company, the soldiers were further divided into platoons and squads. Each company was usually under the command of a captain, who was assisted by a first lieutenant and a second lieutenant.[2] At first, companies had text-based names like the Columbus Rifles or the Mifflin Guards, for example, but after they were further organized they would be assigned a company alphabetic letter, such as “Company G.”
>
> Companies were grouped together to form regiments—the fighting unit with which soldiers most identified. The regiment was the basic maneuver unit of the Civil War. Regiments could consist of just a few companies or as many as fourteen, but ten was the official number—ten companies of 100 men meant that regiments, on paper, were composed of 1,000 officers and men. Yet because of undersized companies, especially as the war progressed the average Civil War regiment at mid-war consisted of 300-500 soldiers. Volunteer regiments were denoted by numbers followed by the state they represented, for example, the 99th Pennsylvania or the 7th South Carolina. Regiments were ideally commanded by colonels (the “commanding officer”) who oversaw two field officers—the lieutenant colonel and the major—and 30 “line” officers: ten captains and twenty lieutenants, who were in charge of the companies. A few more officers might work on the colonel’s staff as adjutants and aides. Noncommissioned officers—sergeant majors, sergeants and corporals—were also responsible for company-level duties.
