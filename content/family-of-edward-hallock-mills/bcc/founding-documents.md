>The first church in Caroline was the Dutch Reformed, which organized in 1812 and put up a large building west of Boiceville in 1820. The minister for twenty-five years was Rev. Garrett Mandeville. Persuaded by his wife's cousin, Simeon DeWitt, to visit Ithaca, he came from Ulster County and served in Ithaca and Trumansburg until 1812, when he bought a farm in Caroline. A post office for Boiceville, opened in 1823, was named Slaterville after Levi Slater, the first town clerk. The village developed to the east with a Methodist church, stores, mills, and taverns to serve the farmers and turnpike traffic.

<blockquote>
In 1868 the CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH was formed at Brooktondale by members of the BROOKTON METHODIST and the REFORMED CHURCH OF AMERICA. A foundation had been created for a Methodist Church, but when the new organization was formed, the Varna Presbyterian Church building was purchased and moved to the Methodist Foundation. The building is in active use by the CAROLINE VALLEY FEDERATED CHURCH. The steeple was blown down during a wind storm in 1925. A fiberglass steeple was lifted to its platform by a crane from H. D. Besemer Co. on 22 June 1977. The bell was bought from the Dutch Reformed Church by the Congregationalists, and is probably the oldest bell in this area.

The volume has been re-bound, likely more than once over the years, so that now it is common for words on the inside edges of pages to be hidden within the more recent binding.

Of the images on this page, those with a white background are scanned images found on a compact disk in the records of the Church, and were likely done by, or at the direction of, Barbara Kone. The remaining images were taken by my phone camera in the Church basement, mostly in Fall 2021, with some additional photographs taken in Spring 2023. 

The numerous overhead fluorescent lights in the basement of the Church made it difficult to avoid casting shadows on the photographs. The green pattern behind is a table covering in the basement of the Church. Elaine Sapp was very helpful and generous with her time helping me with the church's records on these and other occasions. 

In the transcriptions that follow, I normalized inconsistent capitalization and punctuation, but otherwise attempted to faithfully reproduce the text, including misspelled names. 

Also see Amy Atwater's [History of the Congregational Church, Brooktondale, New York]({{% relref "1968-atwater-history" %}}) for a summary of these meetings.

## Reverend William S. Hills

The first pastor of the Congregational Church of Mott's Corners was Rev. William S. Hills (16 May 1834 to 26 Oct 1906), who had most recently come from Pottersville PA. His wife is [Julia Ann (Fuller) Hills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/195170803/julia-ann-hills) (18 Feb 1834 to 10 Jan 1907).

<figure>
<blockquote>
Before Rev. Hills took up his duties, a committee of three was appointed to solicit subscriptions for the pastor’s salary. No figures are given on this, but the pastor hired in 1872 was given a salary of $600, a donation, and a parsonage.

## The Founders

The following are my attempts to identify each person mentioned in the initial meetings, which includes the charter members as well as others recorded helping to organize the church. (Reverend William S. Mills is explored above.)

Note that in the tables that follow the rows can be re-sorted by clicking the appropriate column header.

Starting with their identities and relationships:
  
{{% autotable "/static/data/bcc-founders.csv" "founders-relat" "listing,order-i-c,name-nw,born-i,died-i,notes" "" "" "" "" "" %}}
 
  - "Charter" indicates someone listed in the 25 Apr 1868 meeting. "Atwater" indicates additional names listed as charter members in her *[History of the Congregational Church]({{% relref "1968-atwater-history" %}})*. Finally "Smith" are my additions, to acknowledge the recorded names of others involved in the founding of the Church that were not already included in the other lists.

  - Note that the “Manual”, 100 copies of which were printed in 1868 as mentioned in the 25 April 1868 meeting, corroborates the number of people listed by Amy Atwater in her *History*, stating: “The original members, 55 in number, came from the Methodist E. Church, of Mott’s Corners, N. Y., and from the Reformed Church of America, in the town of Caroline, Tompkins Co., N. Y.”.

  - It was at a meeting on Saturday 02 May 1868 when Alamanza Perry and Richard Sloughter "presented themselves for membership on profession of faith".
 
  - Urena Genung was present at the 12 Mar 1868 meeting, but apparently not at the 25 Apr 1868 meeting.

Edward fought in the 179th Infantry: "Enrolled, August 31, 1864, at Caroline, to serve one year; mustered in as private, Co. B, October 1, 1864; as first lieutenant, October 28, 1864; mustered out with company, June 8, 1865, near Alexandria, Va.

Edward married [Amanda (Sanders) Lounsbery](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338794/amanda-lounsbery) (12 Oct 1842 to 13 Nov 1921). Amanda was clerk in the church for many years, including after Edward's death and many entries in the church records are written by her hand. (She signed many meeting minutes, for example, and the handwriting matches many other handwritten records in the church.) Edward and Amanda also owned the Mills' Store building for many years, and after Amanda's death, Mills' store passed to Amanda's sister Libbie Peck.

#### Walker Voorhis and Ella M. Personius

{{% fig "bcc/obituaries/1914-personius-walker-v-obit-bcc" "800" /%}}

From Molly Adams’ research notes in the Caroline History Room: “Walker Personius was a Civil War veteran and the village postmaster in 1882. He seems to have been the owner of Mott’s original store which he called Personius Hall. The building had a large meeting space on the second floor, with seats that folded down from the wall. Memorial Day (then called Decoration Day) processions always formed in front of that building (see photo) and perhaps the David Ireland Post of Civil War Veterans met in that building. It seems clear that the post office was still at 559 Brooktondale Road in 1882.” I don’t know what photo was being referenced in the preceding passage. 

From “Tour 3 - P8” in A Drive-by Tour of the Town of Caroline: “1st Post Office & store, left – 559 Brooktondale Road. We think this building was built by Mr. Mott, who owned most of the land at that time. …The G.A.R. lined up here to march to the [Quick, presently Brookton] cemetery to put flowers on the graves. There was a tannery between this house and the next before 1853 owned by Silsbury & [Edward] Lounsbery.” 

Walker was also Justice of the Peace at one time.

[Walker Voorhis Personius](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/98386104/walker-voorhis-personius) (1836 to 1914). “Enrolled, August 22, 1861, at Millport; mustered in as captain, Co. G, September 14, 1861, to serve three years; mustered out, September 20, 1864, at Elmira, N.Y.; commissioned captain, October 14, 1861, with rank from September 16, 1861, original.” ([50th Engineer Regiment Unit Roster](https://museum.dmna.ny.gov/unit-history/other-units/50th-engineer-regiment), New York State Military Museum and Veterans Research Center.)

The 50th Engineer Regiment of New York, which also included Walker's brother Charles (below), as well as others from Caroline, organized as the 50th New York Infantry Regiment 18 Sep 1861 in Elmira NY and on 22 Oct 1861: "Detailed as sappers, miners and pontooners, and designated 50th New York Engineers at Washington, D.C. Attached to Woodbury’s Brigade, Army of the Potomac for duty at Alexandria, Va." The Regiment participated in the Chancellorsville, Fredericksburg and Gettysburg campaigns, but they were not on the battlefield at Gettysburg. The Regiment was present at the surrender of General Lee at Appomattox Court House 09 Apr 1865.

#### Charles Personius

[Charles W. Personius](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338759/charles-w-personius) (1840 to 02 Feb 1924) was the owner of Personius Flouring Mills in Brookton, on the present site of Dalebrook. Charles sold a portion of the mill property to to William Wolcott, what would become known as “the Wolcott lot” and later, “The Mills Place”. 

Charles Personius was a Civil War veteran, having enlisted and mustered in 25 Aug 1862 at Middletown NY to Company G of the 50th Engineers Regiment with the rank of Private. He mustered out 13 Jun 1865, Fort Barry VA, under Colonel Pettes, with the rank of Sergeant, having been promoted twice. (New York: Report of the Adjutant-General 1893-1906, ancestry.com)

More information on Charles Personius can be found in the section on [Deeds and Other Past Owners]({{% relref "other-past-owners" %}}).

#### John L. Mandeville

[John L. Mandeville](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/67292637/john-mandeville) (1836 to 29 Nov 1907) was the grandson of [Reverend Garrett Mandeville](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/65244680/garrett-mandeville) (18 May 1775 to 11 Dec 1853), who was the minister of the Dutch Reformed Church that along with the Methodist, split to form the Congregational Church. John Mandeville was a Civil War veteran, and he was a "well-to-do and well known farmer".
He is listed as "surveyor" on the 1866 Stone & Steward map of Mott's Corners.

<!--
In *A Drive-by Tour of the Town of Caroline* sponsored by the Town of Caroline Bicentennial Committee 1994-1995, Tour 4-P9, it is stated that in 1853, John Mandeville had a brickyard next to present-day 341 Brooktondale Road, on the eastern side. The brickyard is visible in the following map in 1853; note that Garrett Mandeville Jr. was John's father.

John Mandeville advocated for the improved roads throughout Tompkins County, including the macadam road constructed in 1912.

<aside>

  - According to [Wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macadam): "Macadam is a type of road construction pioneered by Scottish engineer John Loudon McAdam around 1820, in which crushed stone is placed in shallow, convex layers and compacted thoroughly. A binding layer of stone dust (crushed stone from the original material) may form; it may also, after rolling, be covered with a cement or bituminous binder to keep dust and stones together. The method simplified what had been considered state-of-the-art at that point. ...McAdam's renown is his effective and economical construction, which was a great improvement over the methods used by his generation. He emphasized that roads could be constructed for any kind of traffic, and he helped to alleviate the resentment travelers felt toward increasing traffic on the roads. His legacy lies in his advocacy of effective road maintenance and management. He advocated a central road authority with trained professional officials who could be paid a salary that would keep them from corruption. These professionals could give their entire time to these duties and be held responsible for their actions."

#### Mariette Perry

Although the exact spelling is unclear, how “Mariette” is pronounced is clear from how it is spelled in the 1870 census. She is the daughter of James Perry (04 Dec 1810 to 06 Jun 1898) and [Cynthia (German) Perry](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/96483658/cynthia-perry) (26 Apr 1808 to 02 Jan 1857). At that time, she is a domestic servant living in the town of Taylor, Cortland County NY.

### Funerary Poems 

Finally, the following two poems were also clipped out of newspapers and stored along with similarly clipped obituaries of church members, some of which are shown above. Apparently, they had special significance.

Variations of these lines are quoted often not only in relation to funerals, but also by temperance organizations like the Women's Christian Temperance Union in their proceedings and publications. Typically, two final lines are also quoted.

<blockquote>
<pre>
Passing Away 
Poet: Unknown
<br/>

The fragrance of the rose,
Whose dewy leaves in morning's light unclose,
Goes not more sweetly up
From its rich heart, as from an incense cup,
Than thy freed spirit from its earthly shrine
Passed with the still angel to the rest divine.

Oh no! Thou didst not die!
Thou hast but lain the soul's frail vesture by,
And soared to that pure height
Where day serene is followed by no night,
And where the discipline of mortal woe
No shadow over thee can ever throw.

Death never comes to such
With chillness in the mystery of his touch:
They gently pass away
As melts the morning star in golden day;
They leave the places they have known below,
And through the white gates of the morning go.

We would not call thee back
To the frail flowers that wither on our track,
Perhaps to have thy feet
Pierced by the thorns that we so often meet:
For thou art in that fairer world than ours
Where love mourns not the fading of the flowers.

Why should we weep for thee
When thy pure soul from every ill is free?
Our only tears should flow
For those, the loved, who linger still below,
From whom the light of thy dear smile is fled,
Who feel indeed that thou art with the dead.

We know the gloomy grave
Holds not the spirit which our Father gave;
That loving, lustrous light,
That made the sphere in which it moved so bright,
Is shining with a clear and quenchless flame.
Rekindled at the source from whence it came.

Thou art not dead! For death
Can only take away the mortal breath;
And life, commencing here.
Is but the prelude to its full career;
And Hope and Faith the blest assurance give -
"We do not live to die! We die to live!"
</pre>
