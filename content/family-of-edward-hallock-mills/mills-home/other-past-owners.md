This section explores the historical deeds and the lives of some of the other former owners of the home beginning in the 1860's, when the property is first sub-divided from the lower grist mill and called "The Wolcott Lot" for the first owner of record, William Benton Wolcott, through to the 1960's ownership by Jessie (Shurter) Brewer. It is unclear exactly when the Mills family first moved into the home, although I believe the 1880 census strongly suggests that they lived in the home shortly after their move to Mott's Corners, if not immediately so.

The mid-2000’s real estate listing indicated the home was built in 1865, although I can’t confirm that. As noted in the deed descriptions, the Mills' home was originally part of the grist mill property next door, what is presently Dalebrook Apartments. 

The grist mill was known as the "lower mill" and over the years, the lot was subdivided several times. The roof and foundation of Dalebrook are what survives today of the grist mill structure. Still present in the stone foundation are rings that horses were tied to while wagons were loaded and unloaded in the upper basement level. Evidence of the mill pond and the course of the mill race can still be seen in the landscape in 2022.

Several phrases from the Mills' home deeds are quoted in Molly Adams' "A Note on Emily Mills", including that the house was "part of the grist mill lot" and that it was "occupied by E. H. Mills as tenant" prior to him purchasing the home. 

A summary of the historical deeds referenced below, up to the time it was owned by Jessie Brewer:

The following is the first deed for the property after it was sub-divided from the grist mill lot. Thanks to Alanna Congdon at the Tompkins County Clerks Office, who provided an alternative scan of the original to the one already available online. I present both as each is clearer in areas where the other is not:

## Jacob Vandemark and Charles W. Personius

It appears that the grist mill was co-owned by [Jacob Vandemark](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89241014/jacob-vandemark) (1802 to 15 Dec 1873) and [Charles William Personius](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338759/charles-w-personius) (1840 to 02 Feb 1924). In 1868, Mills' store deeds describe the lot as "nearly on opposite side of the highway from Jacob Vandemark's Grist Mill" (Caroline Deeds 1, p556), and in 1874 the phrase is changed to "nearly on opposite side of the highway from Charles Personius' Mills" (Caroline Deeds 3, p234). In 1934: "nearly opposite the mill formerly owned by Charles Personius, now occupied by the Lockwood apartment building" (Deeds 235, p84). Of course, the Lockwood apartment building is Dalebrook. Jacob's exact role is unclear, but Charles was described elsewhere as a miller, and he is often referred to as the owner of the grist mill in later years, and when it is sold to A. Cameron Vorhis, the mill was called Personius Flouring Mills.

(Personius is sometimes spelled Person**e**us, but it seems that most often Person**i**us is used for Charles and Walker, so I have chosen to stick with that spelling unless quoting someone else.)

Charles Personius was a Civil War veteran, having enlisted and mustered in 25 Aug 1862 at Middletown NY to Company G of the 50th Engineers Regiment with the rank of Private. He mustered out 13 Jun 1865, Fort Barry VA, under Colonel Pettes, with the rank of Sergeant, having been promoted twice. (New York: Report of the Adjutant-General 1893-1906, ancestry.com)

The following from the 50th Engineer Regiment unit roster does differ slightly in some details. 

{{% fig "mills-home/50thEngRoster-Charles-Personius-p1084" "500" /%}}

The locations and activities of Union regiments throughout the Civil War are well documented, providing an indirect account of the soldiers' lives during those years. The 50th Engineer Regiment of New York, which also included Charles' brother Walker, as well as others from Caroline, organized as the 50th New York Infantry Regiment 18 Sep 1861 in Elmira NY and on 22 Oct 1861: "Detailed as sappers, miners and pontooners, and designated 50th New York Engineers at Washington, D.C. Attached to Woodbury’s Brigade, Army of the Potomac for duty at Alexandria, Va." The Regiment participated in the Chancellorsville, Fredericksburg and Gettysburg campaigns, but they were not on the battlefield at Gettysburg. The Regiment was present at the surrender of General Lee at Appomattox Court House 09 Apr 1865.

According to the website [The Civil War in the East](https://civilwarintheeast.com/us-regiments-batteries/new-york-regiments-and-batteries/artillery-and-engineers/50th-new-york-engineers/): "The 50th New York Infantry Regiment, which became the 50th New York Engineer Regiment, lost 1 officer and 19 enlisted men killed or mortally wounded and 1 officer and 206 enlisted men to disease during the Civil War. It is honored by a monument at Gettysburg shared with the 15th New York Engineers."

The wartime experiences of the 50th Engineers were summarized by Captain John T. Davidson in his address of 17 Sep 1890 at the dedication of the Engineers' monument:
 
<figure>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Fiftieth and Fifteenth Engineers were not unlike the rest of the Union volunteers, and it was but a short time before they became as proficient in the art of practical engineering as were the regulars. While the building of forts and intrenchments formed no small part of their duties, the laying and building of bridges across narrow and wide streams were of the greatest value to the army in its thousands of movements in the field. It was always the first on the ground to span the river with a good pontoon bridge, over which the army with its infantry, artillery and cavalry could and did pass over, dry shod and in perfect safety. Its services in this direction won the respect and admiration of the world. I believe I state a fact which cannot be truthfully controverted, that no army known to history was better served in its engineer department, than was the Army of the Potomac. It was not uncommon for us to build a bridge 300 feet in length in thirty minutes. 
</p>
<p>
The greatest difficulty which the engineers experienced was in transporting the long heavy pontoon trains across the country. The Virginia mud and the thousand obstacles encountered while dragging pontoon trains over the country will never be forgotten by the boys who trained in the Engineer Brigade. It has been said that few, in comparison with the losses in other branches of the service, suffered from bullets in the Engineer Brigade; but, on account of the severe service required, more constitutions were wrecked in this than in any other branch of the service. But our exemption from Rebel bullets was not complete, and the mention of Fredericksburg will be a reminder of the first severe baptism of blood the brigade received. Our losses were greater on this occasion than at any time afterwards, because this experience fully demonstrated that pontoon bridges could not be laid in face of the enemy, especially when they were entirely under cover of their rifle pits and intrenchments, and thereafter the rule was to first clear the opposite banks from Rebel muskets.
</p>

Among those who heard these words spoken was Charles' brother Walker who had the honor of "delivering the monument" of his regiment.

<blockquote>
…on June 5, 1863, the Fiftieth, in company with other troops of the Engineer Brigade, assisted in laying a pontoon bridge across the Rappahannock at Franklin's Crossing, or Deep Run, about three miles below Fredericksburg. The Sixth Corps crossed in order to make a demonstration against Lee's right in order to ascertain iſ possible the location of the Confederate Army, the greater part of which had already left Fredericksburg in its march to Pennsylvania . This bridge was also laid under the fire of the enemy's pickets, in which Captain Cross, of the U. S. Engineers, was killed. The detachment of the Fiftieth lost eleven men killed and wounded in this affair, and added to its reputation for efficiency and gallantry under fire, although the men worked unarmed, their duties rendering them unable to reply to the enemy's attack.

Note that several sources corroborate [this](https://npsfrsp.wordpress.com/2011/02/14/exploring-the-lower-crossing/): "Franklin’s Crossing (often called the Lower Crossing because of the three Union crossings at the Battle of Fredericksburg, it was the farthest downstream)". 

Immediately following this event, the Regiment was engaged in the Gettysburg campaign, and their efforts are described in the dedication address by Captain Davidson: 

<figure>
<blockquote>
<p>
The two bridges which this brigade laid across the Potomac at Edwards Ferry, over which the entire Army of the Potomac crossed to meet Lee upon this memorable battlefield, and the two afterwards at Berlin, ten miles above Edwards Ferry, over which it crossed in its return to Virginia, were remarkable structures, under all the circumstances.
</p>
<p>
The river at these two points, as I now recollect, was nearly 1,700 feet in width, and for four days and nights the two bridges at each place were in constant use, and, as is often said, the Army of the Potomac had no reason to complain of the bridges which carried them safely over. Except for the timely services rendered by the Engineer Brigade it is not an unreasonable prediction that the Capital City of the Nation would not have escaped falling into the hands of the enemy, as the usual ways of crossing streams over long - established highways and permanent bridges, oftentimes destroyed by the enemy, were entirely obviated by the temporary bridges and highways built by the engineers, and always at the proper time and place needed.

The next year, 1864, "to expedite the transportation of wounded three Companies [of the 50th Engineers] made a forced march to Fredericksburg, starting at 11:30 a.m. Built bridge over the Rappahannock at Fredericksburg Lower Crossing, having it completed and ready for use at 4:30 p.m., having marched 8 miles and built bridge 420 feet long in 5 hours." ([Civil War in the East](https://civilwarintheeast.com/us-regiments-batteries/new-york-regiments-and-batteries/artillery-and-engineers/50th-new-york-engineers/).)

It isn't clear exactly when or at which crossing the following photos were taken, but the 50th Engineers were in the vicinity of Fredericksburg a number of times over several years, and the Rappahannock crossings were obviously of high strategic importance. There are also accounts that describe these bridges being destroyed and rebuilt.

## William Benton Wolcott

In the 1887 Dalebrook deed (Caroline Deeds 2, p510), the grist mill is described as it was originally "excepting and reserving herefrom the land heretofore conveyed by Jacob Vandemark and Charles W. Personius to Wm. B. Wolcott", the first owner of what was called the "Wolcott Lot" and eventually the "Mills' Place".

[William Benton Wolcott](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100303590/william-benton-wolcott) (06 Oct 1832 to 25 Feb 1911), the son of [George Wolcott](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338779/george-wolcott) (23 Dec 1801 to 09 Dec 1860) and [Sarah A. (Reed) Wolcott](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338780/sarah-a-wolcott) (23 Dec 1804 to 07 May 1886). (George and Sarah died years apart and are not buried next to each other in Brookton Cemetery. As of Summer 2022, both of their stones are broken in half.)

In the three years immediately preceding this purchase, William was a Union soldier in the Civil War, mustering out 09 June 1865. The following Spring, William and his wife [Ellen A. (Shurter) Wolcott Aldrich](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/187990128/ellen-a-aldrich_wolcott) (07 Sep 1843 to 21 Apr 1928), had their only child [Willis B. Wolcott](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/187989322/willis-b-wolcott) (14 Apr 1866 to 10 Nov 1903). The historical deeds for Dalebrook refer to the adjoining property as the "Wolcott lot". If William is indeed the first true owner of the divided lot, given the timing and his expertise, perhaps he had a direct role in its construction.

| 22&nbsp;May&nbsp;1869 | William purchased the "Wolcott lot" from Jacob Vandemark and Charles Personius. |

</figure>
 
William Wolcott is described as follows in the census data:

  - 1850: "Carpenter"
  - 1860: "Carpenter"
  - 1862: "Mechanic" (1865, Complete Record, as Required by Chapter 690, of the Laws of 1865, Relating to Officers, Soldiers and Seamen, Composing the Quotas of the Troops Furnished to the United States, Town of Caroline, County of Tompkins, State of New York, Prepared By Charles L. Davis, ancestry.com.)
  - 1865: "Carpenter"
  - 1870: "Wagon maker"
  - 1875: "Carriage maker"
  - 1880: "Wagon maker"
  - 1892: "Carpenter"
  - 1900: "Day laborer" (and wife Ellen is a "Paperhanger")
  - 1905: "Painter"

In the section that discusses {{% pagelink "me-mills#the-brewer-barn" "\"Brewer Barn\"" %}}, I speculate that William B. Wolcott likely worked for Willis Shurter, and possibly for his father (William Wolcott's father-in-law) Josiah prior, at "Willis Shurter's Wagon Shop in Motts Corners", a structure that yet stands as I write this. This seems all the more likely because William and Ellen lived in the Shurter House with Josiah and Willis between the time William mustered out of service and before moving to the Wolcott Lot. Perhaps William named his son after his former employer.

{{% fig "me-mills/1865-06-26-NYS-census-caroline-p34" "800" /%}}

There are several people close to William with the expertise to help him in the home's construction, including his brothers George W. and John Wolcott, who, like their father before them, were also carpenters.

Both William and his *brother* [George Wolcott](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/99535313/george-wolcott) (1836 to 1916), who also lists himself as a "mechanic" in 1862, were Civil War veterans. (This George Wolcott was the father of [Clarence R. Wolcott](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100452488/clarence-r-wolcott) (1864 to 1950), who acted as Edward Mills' lawyer at one time.) 


In Caroline on 21 Aug 1862, William Wolcott enlisted in Company K of the 137th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, mustering in 25 Sep 1862 at Binghamton NY, with the rank of Orderly Sergeant. (Town Clerks' Registers of Men Who Served in the Civil War, ca 1865–1867. Microfilm publication, 37 rolls. New York State Archives. Albany, New York, ancestry.com.)

The following information from the 137th Regiment's unit roster differs slightly in a few details, but provides his mustering out time and location, as well as acknowledging his promotion a few weeks prior to the Battle of Gettysburg.

{{% fig "mills-home/william-wolcott-union-record" "500" /%}}

In 1863, this Regiment was part of the Chancellorsville and Gettysburg Campaigns, and at the Battle of Gettysburg "commanded by Colonel **David Ireland**, the Regiment brought 456 men to the field. It lost 40 Men killed, 87 wounded, and 10 men missing". Following the battle, the Regiment pursued General Lee to the Manassas Gap. In 1864, the Regiment was involved in the sieges of Atlanta and Savannah. ([137th New York Infantry Regiment](https://civilwarintheeast.com/us-regiments-batteries/new-york-infantry/137th-new-york/), Civil War in the East, emphasis added.) 

The Brookton post of the Grand Army of the Republic (a fraternal organization of Union Army veterans of the Civil War) was named in honor of Colonel David Ireland.

<figure>
<blockquote>
<p>The Grand Army of the Republic was created "in pursuance of Section 3 of Chap. 706 of the laws of 1887, New York State; [an] Act to provide for the relief of indigent soldiers, sailors and marines and the families of those deceased passed June 25, 1887." There were two G. A. R. posts in the Town of Caroline; the Henry Wilson Post #68 in Slaterville Springs, and the <strong>David Ireland Post #158 in Brookton</strong>.
</p>

<p>The Brookton G.A.R. post filed a "notice of intent" on 29 Aug 1887. The officers named in that document were: John W. Gass--Commander, Spencer H. Jansen--Senior Vice-Commander, Sol. (Soloman) Honniss--Jr. Vice Commander, Charles Personius--Quarter Master, Edward Lounsbery-- Chaplain, John Hoover--Surgeon, Samuel Whited--Officer of the day, Willis Shurter--Adjutant, Don C. Hanford--"Sergent" Major, Moses Roe-- Officer of the guard, and the Relief Committee: Edward Lounsbery, Samuel Woodhull, Charles Personius. Later records indicate that other members were: George Barns (or Barnes), Chaplain--Preston Darling, Quarter Master--Isaac Lynch, Adjutant--Henry D. Lock (or Locke), and the Rifle Company consisting of: Leonard Griffon (or Griffen or Griffin), Preston Darling, and Isaac Lynch. Later records indicate that other members who held positions were: George E. Harris, Joel Percell (or Purcell), John Personius, John Randall, John Huslander, Henry S. Krum, David B. Hammond, George Matson.
</p>

<p>The last recorded reports from the posts were on 31 October 1899. In that time period, the "Notice of Intents" that were filed show that Post #158, (Brookton) paid $284.07 for the care and maintenance of veterans and their families and they asked the Town Board for $150.00. Post #68 (Slaterville Springs) paid $168.98. Some of the items that were provided were: board, fuel, clothing, food & tobacco, Doctor and nursing care, transportation to the Veterans Home in Bath, and burials. In February 1912, the David Ireland Post #158 was charged with payment to Fred Warriner for $7.00 worth of goods, and paid.

The Post was written of often over the years in the Brookton news in The Ithaca Journal. Although the David Ireland Post held events in both the Baptist and Congregational Churches in Brookton, the Congregational Church is most often associated with them. It is interesting to note the relationship between the G. A. R. and the W. C. T. U.

[Colonel David Ireland](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/19204/david-ireland) (09 May 1832 to 10 Sep 1864) was born in Scotland and emigrated to New York in 1840, where he eventually apprenticed as a tailor to his father Charles. 

{{% fig "mills-home/IRELAND" "500" /%}}

<figure>
<blockquote>
<p>
Ireland was the mustering officer for new regiments training in Binghamton in the summer of 1862. Recruiting for the new regiment designated the 137th New York Infantry, he was appointed as colonel of the regiment by the governor, citing his "military experience and ability"—"we know him to be a kind and gentlemanly officer and a brave soldier". Ireland trained his new regiment rigorously at Camp Susquehanna in Binghamton. The 137th New York left by train for Washington, D.C., on September 27, 1862.
</p>

<p>
From Washington, Ireland and his regiment were sent directly to join McClellan's Army of the Potomac, in camp near Frederick, Maryland, after the Battle of Antietam. The 137th New York was assigned to XII Corps, then led by Brig. Gen. Alpheus Williams. The corps was part of the reserve at the time of the Battle of Fredericksburg and remained so to the end of 1862.
</p>

<p>
…After leading his brigade into Atlanta on Sep. 2, 1864, Ireland fell ill with dysentery, dying on September 10. His passing was noted with regret by Maj. Gen. Geary in his report on the Atlanta Campaign. Col. Ireland's fellow officers, meeting on September 10, expressed their regret for "his untimely death, as it were, "On the field of his fame and glory".
</p>

<p>
Ireland is buried in Binghamton at Spring Forest Cemetery. The Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War named Camp 137 in Binghamton the Col. David Ireland Camp. On August 26, 1863, Ireland had married Sara Phelps in Binghamton. They had no children.

Obviously Colonel David Ireland's accomplishments were shared by the men he fought beside, including William Benton Wolcott of Mott's Corners, Caroline NY, who can count among their many acts of heroism, the defense of Culp's Hill "one of the most noteworthy incidents of the war", "the loss of this critical sector undoubtedly would have altered the battle's outcome" and that they "helped to raise the Stars and Stripes over Atlanta". The 137th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment is honored by a monument on the Gettysburg battlefield.

{{% fig "mills-home/137thInfMonument" "500" /%}}

According to David Ireland’s Wikipedia entry, the 137th "played a key defensive role on Culp's Hill in the Battle of Gettysburg."

<figure>
<blockquote>
<p>
This regiment won special honor at Gettysburg, then in Greene's Brigade, which held Culp's Hill during a critical period of that battle against desperate attacks of a vastly superior force. The gallant defence of Culp's Hill by Greene's Brigade, and the terrible execution inflicted by its musketry on the assaulting column of the enemy form one of the most noteworthy incidents of the war.
</p>
<p>
…The officers and men behaved admirably during the whole of the contest. Colonel Ireland was attacked on his flank and rear. He changed his position and maintained his ground with skill and gallantry, his regiment suffering very severely.

<blockquote>
<p>
A native of Forfar, Scotland, born in 1832, David Ireland was with the 79th Cameron Highlanders at the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861, and that fall was captain in the 15th U.S. Regulars. In the summer of 1862, he was named colonel of the new 137th New York Infantry, which saw its first combat at Chancellorsville in May 1863.
</p>
<p>
Two months later, on July 2, the 137th—part of Brig. Gen. George S. Greene’s 3rd Brigade, 12th Corps—found itself building entrenchments on Culp’s Hill on the Union right. As fighting raged on the left, it remained relatively quiet for Henry Slocum’s 12th Corps until about 6 p.m., when he was ordered to lend assistance to the threatened Union positions in the Peach Orchard, Wheatfield, and on Little Round Top.
</p>
<p>
As the 12th Corps departed, Confederate Maj. Gen. Edward Johnson’s Division in Lt. Gen. Richard Ewell’s Corps advanced on the vacated Union trenches. Only Greene’s all-New York brigade had been allowed to remain—1,424 men aligned from the summit of Culp’s Hill to Rock Creek. Johnson had 4,678 men, more than enough, and as the Rebels swarmed in, Greene attempted to occupy those trenches, too.
</p>
<p>
To Greene’s fortune, his largest regiment—the 423-man 137th New York—was on his right. Ireland’s men managed to reach trenches previously occupied by Brig. Gen. Thomas Kane’s 2nd Brigade just as the Confederates struck. Leading the attack on Greene’s right was Brig. Gen. George H. Steuart’s 2,100-man brigade.
</p>
<p>
With three Virginia regiments, the 1st Maryland Battalion, and elements of the 1st North Carolina Infantry on hand, Steuart soon learned that Greene’s right was unsupported. The 137th checked Steuart’s advance for a time, but when a Union regiment coming to Ireland’s assistance was driven off the field, the 137th was on its own. “At this time we were fired on heavily from three sides…,” Ireland recalled. “Here we lost severely in killed and wounded.”
</p>
<p>
Though virtually surrounded, Ireland was able to fall back to a traverse line that had been constructed earlier in the day, but he and his men quickly faced a renewed assault—the fighting at close quarters and desperate. Captain Joseph Gregg, Company I, was mortally wounded as his unit contested a threat with fixed bayonets. Again, the 137th somehow kept the Confederates at bay until help arrived. Its ability not to break against such unrelenting pressure, in fact, is one of Gettysburg’s unsung stories. Had the Federals on Culp’s Hill succumbed, the loss of this critical sector undoubtedly would have altered the battle’s outcome. (The 137th New York ironically suffered 137 casualties. It is interesting to note that the more famous bookend regiment, the 20th Maine on Little Round Top, endured the same percentage of loss—32.4 percent.)

The importance of the 137th Regiment's defense of Culp's Hill is echoed elsewhere. 

<figure>
<blockquote>
There has been an impression somewhat prevalent that Culp's Hill was a mere outpost, of little consequence in the battle of Gettysburg. In reality it was one of the most important points in the Union lines. As anyone can see, had Johnson succeeded in establishing his strong division along this ridge, almost directly in rear of Cemetery Hill, supported as he was by the other divisions of Ewell's Corps, comprising at least one-third of the entire Confederate army, Meade would have been forced to retreat; he would have been flanked from his position without the firing of a shot, and the road to Baltimore and Washington left open to the invader. Retreat at that time meant nothing less than rout, disaster and ruin to the Union army.

In Caroline, Apr 1861, George Wolcott, William Wolcott's brother, enlisted in Company G of the 32nd New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment and mustered in 31 May 1861 with the rank of Sergeant under Colonel Roderick Matheson, Lieutenant Colonel Francis E. Pinto and Major George F. Lemon. The 32nd regiment was in reserve at the First Battle of Bull Run (a battle in which David Ireland fought in Sherman’s Third Brigade, prior to his taking command of the 137th infantry), covering the retreat of the army, 21 July 1861 in what was the first major battle of the Civil War. George was eventually promoted to First Lieutenant, and his records note that he "was in seven days battles before Richmond". (Town Clerks' Registers of Men Who Served in the Civil War, ca 1865–1867.

The Seven Days Battles were a series of seven battles over seven days from June 25 to July 1, 1862, near Richmond, Virginia, during the American Civil War. Confederate General Robert E. Lee drove the invading Union Army of the Potomac, commanded by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, away from Richmond and into a retreat down the Virginia Peninsula. …The Seven Days ended with McClellan's army in relative safety next to the James River, having suffered almost 16,000 casualties during the retreat.

## Reverend Horace N. Humiston Sr.

{{% fig "mills-home/car-deeds-5-70" "800" /%}}

[Reverend Horace N. Humiston Sr.](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/113971483/horace-n-humiston) (08 Jun 1806 to 26 Feb 1888) married [Eunice H. Humiston](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/113971540/eunice-j-humiston) (18 Sep 1804 to 11 Aug 1889).  Reverend Humiston is described in census records as "minister" in 1870, "Preacher M. E." in 1875, and "preacher" in 1880, all years in Candor. There are newspaper accounts indicating they lived in Caroline and Brookton specifically, although you will notice that both of the following items were printed *after* the Humistons sold the home to Esther Vorhis on 01 Apr 1885.

<div class="cols">
{{% fig "mills-home/humiston/1885-09-19-Ithaca-Daily-Journal-Ithaca-NY-p3" "350" /%}}

</div>

I believe there is compelling evidence to cast doubt on the Humiston's living in Mills' Home while they briefly owned it. Consider the 1880 census for Caroline, the same year the Humistons are recorded in Candor:

{{% fig "census/census-1880-us-focused" "800" /%}}

Comparing this to the 1866 Stone & Stewart map, we can see that on 18 Jun 1880, a Friday, the census "enumerator", in this case, William Wolcott's brother [John Wolcott](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338781/john-w-wolcott) (1830 to 1897), was walking from west to east along the southern side of Creek Road before switching to the northern side of the road and continuing eastward. I am still researching property deeds to get more context for where the Wolcott's were at that time, but if we assume the Mills are already living in Mills' Home, then, the names that follow make sense: A. C. Vorhis had purchased the grist mill in 1877; Lewis Gale, who continued his father's "tin shop", starting in 1873, was after that; then the Vandemark woolen mill was after that. (Read more about the Gale family in the section on [the stone foundation]({{% relref "property-features#the-stone-foundation" %}}).) 

I am continuing to research the property deeds along Brooktondale Road to try to verify where exactly the Wolcott's were living at that time, but this strongly suggests to me that the Mills moved into their ultimate home very soon after moving to Mott's Corners.

Reverend Humiston's son [Horace N. Humiston Jr.](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/113830259/horace-n-humiston) (11 Aug 1826 to 29 Jun 1889) was a high profile lawyer in Ithaca by the late 1800's, and in the census data, he is described as "carpenter" in 1860 and 1865 in Danby, "lawyer" in 1875, and "detective" in 1880. At the Annual Session of the Board of Supervisors of Tompkins County in 1885, Horace Humiston is listed as "detective service for coroner" (14 Dec 1885, Ithaca Daily Journal, Ithaca NY, p1, nyshistoricnewspapers.org). Many stories were reported on Horace Jr. in the Ithaca papers, particularly around his court cases, and the Ithaca City Directory in 1883 shows the breadth of his professional activities.

Horace Jr.’s daughter was also a Slater: [Cora J. (Humiston) Slater](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/101229340/cora-j-slater) (1865 to 1934) who married [Charles A. Slater](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/101229259/charles-a-slater) (1867 to 1918). 

Horace Jr. was portrayed in the Ithaca Daily Journal as a local celebrity, a man familiar with the darker elements of Ithaca society, and a man with many enemies, so there was great interest when he was tried and convicted in “The Humiston Case”  of "Keeping a Disorderly House". 

<figure>

> A place where individuals reside or which they frequent for purposes that pose a threat to public health, morals, convenience, or safety, and that may create a public nuisance. A disorderly house is an all-inclusive term that may be used to describe such places as a house of prostitution, an illegal gambling casino, or a site where drugs are constantly bought and sold. It is any place where unlawful practices are habitually carried on by the public.

Based on the reporting of that "young boys are very properly kept from the court house during the testimony" further described as "prurient", one can surmise this was a brothel.

[Esther Charlotte (Cary) Vorhis](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/148400355/esther-vorhis) (1836 to 23 Jan 1917) is the second wife of [Andrew Cameron Vorhis](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/21978492/andrew-cameron-vorhis) (1825 to 05 Aug 1889), who commonly went by Cameron, and the mother of [Frank Cameron Vorhis](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100452322/frank-cameron-vorhis) (1861 to 1919). Cameron Vorhis purchased the grist mill from Charles Personius, and Cameron's sons eventually took it over from him when Cameron retired, a few years prior to when the mill is said to have burned.

From Molly Adams in *The Towns of Tompkins County*, p56: "The present store [known as Brookton's Market in 2022], on the site of a plastermill, seems to have started about 1890, under Frank Vorhis." According to the Brookton's Market 2011 Calendar, Frank owned the general store at that location until its sale to the Mulks brothers in 1902, when it became known as Frank F. Mulks. 

Frank Vorhis is the father of [Charlotte Esther (Vorhis) Pancoe](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/162242537/charlotte-esther-pancoe) (02 Aug 1893 to 19 May 1964) who was [baptized]({{% relref "baptism" %}}) with Emily and Jessie Brewer and is often referred to as "Miss Esther Vorhis" during that time.

Frank's son [Charles Vorhis](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/162243893/charles-vorhis) (1913 to 1973) eventually bought the Mill's store building and moved the post office to that location in 1961, according to Molly Adams' "A Note on Emily Mills." Charles also owned Dalebrook at one time.

## Edward and Amanda Lounsbery
 
{{% fig "mills-home/138-329" "800" /%}}

This deed contains the first mention of the Mills family, living in the home "as tenants" prior to owning it, at least by June 1891, and possibly earlier. It seems most likely that Edward and Amanda never occupied the home themselves.

[Edward Lounsbery](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338793/edward-lounsbery) (11 Oct 1833 to 27 Nov 1904) was a tanner and currier, a Civil War veteran, and a founding member of the David Ireland Post #158 in Brookton. Both Edward and his wife [Amanda (Sanders) Lounsbery](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338794/amanda-lounsbery) (12 Oct 1842 to 13 Nov 1921) were leaders of the High Bridge Lodge of the temperance organization the {{% pagelink "good-templars" "Independent Order of Good Templars" %}}.

Edward entered the 179th New York Infantry Regiment, Company B as a private on 31 Aug 1864 and was promoted to First Lieutenant on 11 Dec 1864. Edward's Company, "Co B was at surender [sic] of Lee". Company B also included Fred Elmer Bates, Nelson J. Edwards, John James Roe, John Ault, and Dan C. Hanford, among others from Caroline.

Records of what is known today as Caroline Valley Community Church show that Edward was one of the original organizers and members of the Church, present at the "informal meeting" on 05 Mar 1868 at the home of Walker V. Personius that resulted in the organization of the Congregational Church of Mott's Corners on 12 Mar 1868, when Edward, along with his wife Amanda, are listed as charter members. It is noted in the Church's meeting minutes that at the 05 Mar meeting "on motion of Edward Lounsbery Mr. William Personeus was chosen chairman and Walker V. Personius secretary." Edward died within the Congregational Church while addressing the Christian Endeavor Society. For more context on the founding of the Congregational Church of Mott's Corners, see [this section]({{% relref "founding-documents" %}}).

Amanda was clerk in the church for many years, including after Edward's death and many entries in the church records are written by her hand. (She signed many meeting minutes, for example, and the handwriting matches many other handwritten records in the church.) Edward and Amanda also owned the Mills' Store building for many years, and after Amanda's death, Mills' store passed to Amanda's sister Libbie Peck.

<blockquote>
In 1903 Charlie Jones set up the Caroline Farmers Telephone Company in Slaterville. From the beginning there were not enough telephones to satisfy demand. As late as 1925, clusters of homes north of Caroline, east of Slaterville Springs, and south of Brookton had almost no service. After an outbreak of typhoid fever in Ithaca in 1903, the Board of Health investigated properties along Six Mile Creek in Brookton and Slaterville and reported on the number of manure piles, tanning vats, hoghouses, and privies that polluted the waters flowing to Ithaca.

Edward H. Mills died without a will on 01 Jan 1908, and it would take some time for Hannah and Emily to fully establish ownership of the home.

Emily Mills died 03 Nov 1937, like her father, without a will. 

[Fred D. Gilbert](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/183607645/fred-d-gilbert) (24 Apr 1873 to 14 Nov 1941) was a prominent Ithaca businessman, and was Emily's undertaker. His obituary states that he spent his boyhood in Brookton because his father, Rev. Herbert B. Gilbert, was pastor of the Congregational Church in 1872-1873. (*History of the Congregational Church, Brooktondale, New York.* Compiled and edited by Mrs. Amy Atwater on the occasion of The Centennial Celebration of the Caroline Valley Federated Church, Brooktondale, New York, June 16th, 1968.) Fred took a lifelong interest in his boyhood home, as evidenced for example, by his contribution to the Lockwood Memorial described elsewhere in this material. Fred was also known as an owner of light harness horses and as an organizer of the Tompkins County Fair.

The first three names of possible heirs listed in the [Mills' home deeds]({{% relref "other-past-owners" %}}) from the time of Emily's death are the children of James Thomas Mills, Edward H. Mills' younger brother:
  - Alonzo W. Mills (Jul 1858 to 09 May 1942) Sometimes spelled as Alonso.
  - George E. Mills (Feb 1856 to 10 Apr 1944). 
  - [Clarissa H. (Mills) Etsell](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/74907705/clarissa-h.-etsell) (Jun 1852 to Jan 1946). (Her name is misspelled as "Etsall" on the deeds, and elsewhere has been spelled "Edsall".)

[Mary Halliock (Huntting) Smith (1845–1938)](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/24792330/mary-halliock-smith) is another cousin of Emily's, the daughter of Edward's sister, Emily Tabitha (Mills) Huntting. For more information on these branches of the Mills family, see the accompanying account of the Mills' [Long Island origins]({{% relref "smithtown" %}}).

[Jessie M. (Shurter) Brewer](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/99536961/jessie-m-brewer) (27 Jun 1881 to 16 Sep 1974) was baptized with Emily in 1907 and married [Lewis William Brewer](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/99536898/lewis-william-brewer) (24 Jun 1882 to 10 Sep 1963) in Danby, 27 Jun 1923. Jessie purchased the Mills' store real estate a few years before Emily's death, and when Emily died, Jessie took over [M. E. Mills]({{% relref "me-mills" %}}), renaming it after herself and selling dry goods and notions, but no longer selling groceries as Emily had. It appears Jessie and Lewis Brewer never occupied Mills' home, and instead rented it until it was purchased by [the Jones family]({{% relref "jones-lattin-talmadge" %}}).

I know of several photos of Jessie Brewer, including formal portraits as well as candid photos. She is present in the Congregational Church "cleaning day" photo, and I have seen a photo of her, in an album donated to the Caroline History Club in Fall 2021 by the Lounsbery family, which shows Jessie Brewer walking in a parade next to a man (Lewis?) who is dressed as "Uncle Sam".

I don't currently understand the apparent connection between Jessie Brewer and Dryden. I have contacted both Southworth Library in Dryden as well as the Dryden Town Historical Society, and neither organization has any information on her.

See more information on the Jones family, the Lattins, and Andrea Talmadge [here]({{% relref "jones-lattin-talmadge" %}}).

The evidence strongly suggests to me that of the owners of Mills' Home prior to the Jones family, only the Wolcotts and Mills actually occupied the home.
