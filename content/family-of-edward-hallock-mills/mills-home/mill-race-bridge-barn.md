In the 1860's, when Brooktondale was called Mott's Corners, and Brooktondale Road was called Creek Road, the lower grist mill that was known for a time as Personius Flouring Mills sat where Dalebrook Apartments sit presently, almost directly across the street from Mills' Store, a building better known to many today as "The Old Post Office". What would later become known as “The Mills' Place” was sub-divided from the grist mill property, and it was originally referred to as "The Wolcott Lot" for William Benton Wolcott, the first owner of record. The Mill Race Bridge is one of the primary landmarks used to establish the Place of Beginning for the Mills' Home parcel from the time of its original sub-division from the grist mill to the end of Emily Mills' life. This section attempts to accurately locate the Mill Race Bridge and describe its shape and size.

## Introducing The Grist Mill Raceway and the Tailrace Bridge

For a long time, I have wanted to know more about the location and size of the Mill Race Bridge, to re-envision this aspect of Emily's world and better understand the history of the property. The members of the Mills household would need to cross the Mill Race Bridge, either by foot or wagon, to get to their store and the Congregational Church from their home. The original wooden bridge must have amplified the sounds of carriages and wagons passing over it. 

I will examine the available documentary evidence that directly references the mill raceway and bridge, and I will also add historical context that may aid interpretation of that evidence, beginning with *some* of the historical deeds for the grist mill/Dalebrook property during the relevant time period that will be discussed.

(The historical deeds for Dalebrook and Brookton's Market, the former lower grist mill and woolen mill respectively, are very complex, in terms of ownership, property lines and water rights to the raceway, and as a result, the deeds above are simply those I have found so far that I have been able to confirm and which are relevant to the Mills' property. As time allows, I will try to obtain a more complete and accurate account. [TODO: investigate deeds: Car 1/516, Car 1/518, Car 2/425, 134/69.])

The following photograph shows the lower grist mill after it was rebuilt from the 1890 fire, and likely in the last years before it was dismantled. For more specific information on the mill itself, see {{% pagelink "lower-grist-mill" %}}.

The grist mill was powered by water diverted from Six Mile Creek into a mill pond located behind Mulk’s Store/Brookton’s Market. 

<figure>

> A mill race, millrace or millrun, mill lade (Scotland) or mill leat (Southwest England) is the current of water that turns a water wheel, or the channel (sluice) conducting water to or from a water wheel. Compared with the broad waters of a mill pond, the narrow current is swift and powerful. The race leading to the water wheel on a wide stream or mill pond is called the head race (or headrace), and the race leading away from the wheel is called the tail race (or tailrace).

In the 1866 Photographic Atlas of Tompkins County by Stone & Stewart, part of the mill raceway is represented, from its origin at Six Mile Creek up to the point that it intersects with Creek Road on its return to Six Mile Creek.

{{% fig "brookton/maps/1866-atlas-motts-corners-cropped" "800" "img,cite,link" /%}}

The map was obviously drawn some time before its 1866 publication date, so the absence of Mills' Home is not necessarily inconsistent with its purported construction in 1865.

The portion of the raceway that crosses Mills' Home is the grist mill tailrace, and is either directly referenced as such, or descriptively referenced as the race that exits the grist mill. There is obviously a corresponding bridge across the mill headrace on the portion of Brooktondale Road (as it is presently designated) to the east of the grist mill, the portion that was known at different times in the past as "Back Road", "Easy Street", and "Creek Road". The historical deeds of the relevant properties in that area also reference this bridge, often simply generically as "the mill race bridge", not specifying its relative position either directly or descriptively as was done with the tailrace bridge. Descriptions of the headrace bridge will be near School House Road, what I know as Vandemark Road.

The following is the only photograph of which I am aware that shows the lower grist mill tailrace, taken sometime after the mill was rebuilt from the 1890 fire, and likely before 1900. 

{{% fig "lower-grist-mill/tailrace-scaled" "800" /%}}

The headrace fed into the mill pond behind Mulks' Store, presently Brookton's Market. I have seen a photograph of the grist mill and store that shows water flowing out of the pond into the grist mill. According to *A Drive-by Tour of the Town of Caroline* sponsored by the Town of Caroline Bicentennial Committee 1994-1995, and corroborated by other accounts, there were three mills on the site of Dalebrook, all of which apparently burned. Also in the past, there was a plaster mill and a woolen mill directly next to the grist mill property to the east. Throughout the historical deeds for these properties, access to water rights are explicitly reserved for each.


A collection of Tompkins County highway maps published in 1912 depict the course of the mill raceway in more detail, including what may be a visual representation of the Mill Race Bridge, and if this interpretation is correct, then it is the only visual representation of the Mill Race Bridge of which I am aware. This and other maps in the 1912 series still list the owner of Mills' Home as E. H. Mills, which can be explained by the fact that John Mandeville's obituary describes the surveyors working in 1907, while Edward was still alive. These maps also depict the Brookton Trestle, on at least two maps.

When I initially envisioned the mill race crossing Brooktondale Road, I assumed that it would do so perpendicular to the road, thus simplifying the bridge infrastructure needed. I imagined a rather small channel for the tailrace and assumed that the Mill Race Bridge was probably a modest structure. So, I was surprised to see it depicted as flowing across the road at an angle, requiring a much more substantial structure to span even a small channel. However, [ground penetrating radar]({{% relref "#echoes-of-the-tailrace" %}}) scans done in 2023 corroborate that the course of the raceway in 1912 (at the end of the raceway's existence) flowed to the southwest across the road, at an angle that I would visually estimate is less than 45 degrees relative to the road.

And a more substantial bridge makes sense from other data points, such as its choice as a landmark defining the Place of Beginning in the deed descriptions of 1869 and 1883, and Andrea Talmage's recollections of her conversation with Carl English, referenced in full further below, in which he told her that the mill race bridge gave Mills' Home "the nickname ‘bridge’s house’ or something like that".   

I believe the angled, southwest course of the raceway under the road can be explained by a few factors. First, understand that Dalebrook has a basement that is at ground level, but Frank Proto has told me that the mill infrastructure itself is in a *sub-basement* of the building, and so, it is from the sub-basement that the raceway emerges, and in the middle of the western side of the Dalebrook foundation, a grill recessed in the ground still exists as I write this as evidence of this past configuration.

(It should be noted however, that as I recall Frank explaining to me, the functional areas of the former mill are currently inaccessible behind a concrete wall, and he has never seen that area himself.)

Consulting a *current* topographical map shows what is evident to my naked eye, that the slope of the ground over this portion of the raceway is very gradual. Note that a topographical line falls across the approximate area of former southern edge of the raceway behind Brookton's Market, but otherwise, this topographical map indicates the land from the western side of Brookton's Market to past the point of Todi's fence, completely encompassing the mill tailrace in the area being considered and for a large area around it, descends less than ten feet:

{{% fig "brookton/maps/topographical-map" "800" /%}}

The topography suggests to me that a possible reason for why the raceway was apparently built to follow a gradual southwest diagonal course under the road: over a shallow grade, a straighter course offers less resistance to the flow of water. Perhaps straightening the turn at the road would also have benefits from an engineering standpoint, despite the larger bridge infrastructure needed. 

In fact, as I write this, Six Mile Creek itself crosses Brooktondale Road diagonally, as multiple maps, including the topographical map, as well as photographs, including two presented further below, all attest. It wasn’t always this way, and I will explain that further on. 

Although I was initially tempted to believe that the 1912 highway survey shows the eastern property boundary of Mills' Home aligning with the end of the Mill Race Bridge, which could help derive an estimate for the span of the bridge, it appears that this line, labelled "R818", is not intended to represent the property boundary, at least, not directly. Note that this line is solid like other measurement lines on the map, and it is not dashed like the other property lines shown. Also, there is a line to the east of Mulk's store with the same label, which seems to indicate a relationship between the two lines that I admittedly don't fully understand currently, but which could perhaps be reasonably accurately measured today to provide further insight into Mill Race Bridge’s position. Regardless, it seems that **the shared boundary line designating the eastern edge of Mills' Home and the western edge  of Dalebrook is not represented on the 1912 highway survey**.

<figure>

> The "R818" is Radius 818 feet at the beginning of the curve, just the other side of the "store" is a reverse curve ending the Radius of 818' to the Left and beginning Radius of 60' to the Right. That being said it answers the next question: this line does not represent the boundary line. This map does not show this property line at all. The property lines between land owners shown on this map and most all highway maps are to be taken as "approximate" because highway maps are mapping the "highway" and any land needed for appropriations for highway purposes and do not do all the work necessary to determine the boundaries of the land owners. Most are shown per lines of "occupation".

The next logical question in my mind was about the bridge design: would it have been built at a diagonal, simply following the course of the raceway channel and having offset guard rails, as depicted with the solid, horizontal green lines below, or would it be squared up, so that the abutments on each side fell on lines perpendicular to the road, as depicted with the vertical dashed green lines below. The depiction of the diagonal orientation is based on the assumption that the upper guard rail (or some part of the bridge structure) is represented on the map, that I then replicated at the correct angle on the southern edge of the road along with a portion of the bridge over the cement walk that also must have existed. The dashed vertical red line estimates the center of the Mill Race Bridge at the center of Creek Road

{{% fig "brookton/maps/1912-highway-p2-lower-cropped-lines-zoomed" "800" /%}}

For now, I will point out that we don’t have to look far for an example of each type of bridge construction, which can *both* be found in the lower bridge over Six Mile Creek. As evidenced by the 1912 highway map above, and by the photo below, the lower bridge was originally built perpendicular to Six Mile Creek, when what I know as Brooktondale Road and Valley Road were not connected as they are presently. 

{{% fig "mills-home/masons/brookton-calendar-jan-photo" /%}}

This photo was likely taken in the window of time between the first two Mills' Home deeds that first describe the Mill Race Bridge, based on the purported presence of William Gale's tin shop, as explained in the section exploring [the stone foundation of Mills' Home]({{% relref "property-features/#the-stone-foundation" %}})

But as I will explore further below, along with photograph showing it, the configuration of the lower bridge changed in the 1960's, as what are presently named Brooktondale Road and Valley Road, and which had been two visually distinct roads connected by the lower bridge, were joined in such a way as to straighten the course of the roads at the bridge, with the bridge oriented diagonally over the creek and guard rails on each side offset from the bridge center. 

But ultimately, because these 1912 maps are highway surveys and not property surveys, and because it is clear that the represented property boundaries and structures were not measured for the purposes of these surveys, I conclude that all property boundaries on the 1912 highway surveys should be interpreted as approximations, as should the placement of physical structures such as dwellings, and the Mill Race Bridge, and even landmarks such as the mill raceway itself. If it is not measured, I assume it is merely illustrative. 

So, where exactly was the bridge relative to Mills' Home? What follows are my best attempts to estimate the location of the mill race bridge based on references to it in historical deeds and associated property survey maps of Mills' Home and Dalebrook. Essentially, to understand the location of the Mill Race Bridge, one must understand the history of the boundary line shared by Mills' Home and Dalebrook, which is not straightforward.  


## Echoes of the Tailrace

<a href="gpr-report.pdf"></a>

Evidence of the mill pond and the mill race can still be seen in the landscape as I write this. A clear example can be found in the disturbed area of fencing along the eastern side of Todi's property in 2023, the property shown with the name Gardner Perry in the 1912 highway survey. In the following photographs, you can see the top of the fence dips in an area where wooden poles are reinforcing it.

As I write this, based on Andrea Talmadge's recollections of her conversation with Carl English, the mill raceway still exists, hidden underground, filled with stone instead of water. The remaining physical evidence, which would include soil disturbances from the creation of the channel and placement of bridge infrastructure, such as abutments, suggested to me the possibility that the location of the mill race bridge, and indeed, the entire length of the mill raceway could potentially be re-charted if this evidence could be uncovered.

Obviously, the methods used must be non-invasive and non-destructive. I was vaguely aware of ground penetrating radar (GPR) and found a local company willing to try to locate the raceway based on my research at the time.

<figure>

> Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is a geophysical method that uses radar pulses to image the subsurface. It is a non-intrusive method of surveying the sub-surface to investigate underground utilities such as concrete, asphalt, metals, pipes, cables or masonry. This nondestructive method uses electromagnetic radiation in the microwave band (UHF/VHF frequencies) of the radio spectrum, and detects the reflected signals from subsurface structures. GPR can have applications in a variety of media, including rock, soil, ice, fresh water, pavements and structures. In the right conditions, practitioners can use GPR to detect subsurface objects, changes in material properties, and voids and cracks. 
>
> GPR uses high-frequency (usually polarized) radio waves, usually in the range 10 MHz to 2.6 GHz. A GPR transmitter and antenna emits electromagnetic energy into the ground. When the energy encounters a buried object or a boundary between materials having different permittivities, it may be reflected or refracted or scattered back to the surface. A receiving antenna can then record the variations in the return signal. The principles involved are similar to seismology, except GPR methods implement electromagnetic energy rather than acoustic energy, and energy may be reflected at boundaries where subsurface electrical properties change rather than subsurface mechanical properties as is the case with seismic energy.

My goal was to try to unequivocally find the mill raceway and verify the approximate location of the bridge for comparison against the survey maps, and also to record any findings in such a way that others, particularly future 475ers, could find the same points with reasonable accuracy in the future with less effort than it took me. 

On 29 Jun 2023, witnessed by me, a technician from the company Ground Penetrating Radar Systems scanned the western part of the Dalebrook lot, the Mills' Home lot, and the road in front of Mills Home on both the northern and southern sides. I also had him look for evidence of [the barn]({{% relref "#the-barn" %}}), that will be presented in that section. 

Mike Bishop, the GPR technician, used the word "confident" to describe the GPR findings and the marks he was making, although obviously there is going to be some level of imprecision in where he placed the marks based on his interpretation of the scans. Also note that page 2 of the GPR report below states "GPR imagery was very poor on the asphalt", and in a 06 Jul 2023 follow-up email, he said "the [GPS] signal wasn't the greatest". Otherwise, the following pages from the GPR report describe the process, limitations, and findings.

Along with the caveat about the strength of the Global Positioning System (GPS) signal, I would also add that in the following projection onto Google Maps, the images of the structures on the property appear to be distorted, and in my opinion, they don't give the best sense of where the raceway falls relative to the structures, compared to how they seem to me to fall when I am actually outside looking at the markings made. I also asked Mike to take GPS readings down the center of the road and the center of the detected channel, and I have circled in red the center of the detected channel at the center of the present road.

Further below, I will compare these findings against the Mills' Home survey maps. For now, I have supplemented the GPR report with my own photographs that include red lines and arrows to further highlight the red spray paint and pink pin flags, to try to give a better sense of the raceway. 

Beginning on the Dalebrook lot, the raceway approaches and crosses the boundary with Mills' Home on a course parallel to Brooktondale Road.

(Note that the spray paint appears darker red on the grass, and pink on the asphalt road.)

After crossing the shared boundary line, the raceway turns toward the road close to the small magnolia tree:

In the weeks leading up to this scan, the shed was re-sided. The door was not yet painted when these photographs were taken. The weather had recently been quite wet after an usually dry Spring. The lawn had been quite brown, but in these photos is green again, but a bit overgrown. Also, a few weeks before the scan, Brooktondale was affected by Canadian wildfires which created a thick haze in the air along with a very noticeable smell of smoke and poor air quality. At its worst, the haze made Bald Hill barely visible from Mills' Home.

I took my own measurements based on landmarks that are depicted on Dresser's 2023 survey completed a few months prior. Measurements of the utility pole and Point B were taken perpendicular to the road at the road edge.

<figure>

| Inches <br> Measured | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| 124 | Dalebrook raceway width |
| 220 | northern road edge raceway width | 
| 182 | southern road edge raceway width | 
| 186 | NE corner of raceway at northern edge of road to utility pole | 
| 282 | NE corner of raceway at northern edge of road to Point B | 
|  96 | utility pole to Point B | 

</figure>

Then, using the same approach I used to create the pseudo-surveys at the appropriate scale, I created the following overly onto Dresser. Point A, the center of the Mill Race Bridge at the center of Creek Road, is indicated with a red dot that is on a line perpendicular to the road that intersects the southeast corner of the original foundation. I am assuming that this would be the same approximate point in space regardless of whether the bridge were diagonal or square with the road. 


The northern edge of the channel is oriented based on distance of the northeast corner of the channel to the utility pole. And, as shown in photographs above, the center of the channel at the southern edge of the road is roughly on a perpendicular line that approximately intersects the southwest corner of the original Mills' Home foundation, and I placed it on the map accordingly. This is all quite imprecise obviously, but for my purpose here, I believe the accuracy is sufficient. 

Remember that the diagonal lines across the road don't represent the bridge itself, but the edges of the channel detected by GPR. For simplicity, I am representing the raceway channel as straight diagonal lines across the road joining the two sides, even though the GPR shows the eastern side of the channel with a bend in it, resulting in a widening in the middle of the road. But also remember that page 2 of the GPR report states "GPR imagery was very poor on the asphalt", so for my purposes here, I think this simplified representation is sufficient, and may arguably mitigate the weaker asphalt signals, but bear in mind that the center dot may be slightly to the east of where I have placed it on Dresser, and overall, whether the bridge was diagonal or square with the road, it would have covered a significantly larger area than these lines may imply.

 
I am not sure if these alignments are inherently meaningful, but at the very least, they help visually estimate the location of the Mill Race Bridge in the real world.  

It is interesting to note that a line perpendicular to the road that intersects the Old Iron Pipe lines up close to the eastern edge of the channel on the northern side, and may provide an explanation for its placement. I will explore this more in the section on the [Old Iron Pipe]({{% relref "#the-old-iron-pipe" %}}), below. 

Now overlaying the *Magnetic* interpretation of 1869 on the Dresser and raceway diagram shows that the Place of Beginning roughly corresponds with the center of the raceway at the center of the road, 71 links west of Point A, where we expect the center of the Mill Race Bridge to be, a clear mis-match. 
 

I am intrigued that Point A on Magnetic 1869 is at a distance from the GPR detected center that is roughly equal to the distance given in Step 1, but if that is a relevant consideration, I don't currently understand it.

Next, I overlaid the *True north* interpretation of 1869 on Dresser and the raceway diagram.


Although the Mill Race Bridge center in the center of the road, Point A, does not intersect the GPR detected center, it comes closer, and intriguingly, it does approximately intersect the center of the raceway channel on the northern edge of the road. Further correcting the diagram to accurately reflect the detected bend of the raceway under the road would not be enough to align the two diagrams at the center of the road. After a visual inspection of the marked points in the real world, I estimate that the center of the raceway at the center of the road would still fall several feet to the west of the western edge of the raceway at the northern side of the road. Even after shifting my True north 1869 pseudo survey to the west so that Point B lines up precisely with Miller's Bent Pipe, I still can't get the two road center points close enough to claim a direct match. 

How can the physical evidence be reconciled the surveys? I don't have an explanation but can provide some possibilities to consider.

Remember that at present, I only have the evidence of the raceway channel as an estimate of the Mill Race Bridge location, and I am assuming that the raceway center approximately matches the center of the Mill Race Bridge, what I have called Point A. Ideally we would know more about the bridge's construction, but I know of no photographs or other visual records or recorded details of any kind about the Mill Race Bridge structure, and it seems unlikely there are any to be discovered. 

Also, **the raceway channel detected by GPR is the raceway at it was at the end of its life**, before being filled in and covered. It is of course possible that the raceway course changed over time, and this is really the only theory I have presently that might explain the apparent discrepancy. Remember that the road itself did not change location or course, and although it is reasonable to assume that the road widened over time, and perhaps the widening favored one side, thus slightly shifting the center, I don't believe this can account for the difference seen, and it would seem that this information is beyond our knowledge anyway. In fact, trying to estimate the most favorable interpretations of all of the possible adjustments I have mentioned, taken together, still doesn't adequately account for the difference, in my estimation, using the methods available to me.

But of course, there is unlikely to be existing direct evidence of an older raceway course to be discovered. However, I will point out that the grist mill's capacity was expanded after Cameron Vorhis purchased it in January 1877, the time between the two initial Mills' Home deeds, and a few years after the completion of the Mott's Corners Wooden Trestle. 

<div class="cols">

</div>
{{% fig "mills-home/1880-02-18-Ithaca-Daily-Journal-Ithaca-NY-p4b" "350" /%}}
</div>

Also, recall from earlier that the grist mill burned three times, and one of those (presumably the last) occurred in 1887, after the two initial Mills' Home deeds. This may have been an opportunity to rebuild the mill to a larger capacity as well.

A larger mill wheel would require a larger volume of water to move it, and obviously, this in turn would increase the volume of water passing through the tailrace, possibly necessitating changes to the course of the raceway.

Even if the raceway course did not change over time, there is still our ignorance about the structure of the bridge itself. This would be a (presumably wooden) structure that would need to be maintained, repaired, and presumably completely rebuilt at times, separate from the maintenance of the road itself. Perhaps the Mill Race Bridge center shifted significantly over time independent of the raceway's course, due to factors of which I am unaware. 

One final point to consider is the potential impact the Mill Race Bridge had on the choice of Place of Beginning. Step 2 in 1869 passes near the eastern edge of the raceway on the northern side of the road, and because the Mill Race Bridge structure must have extended beyond the raceway, the possibility that the bridge would obstruct this line should be considered. Notice that **the Mill Race Bridge is less likely to obstruct the Magnetic version of Step 2**:


This may provide more context for understanding the change in Place of Beginning in 1883. Aside from being simpler and more direct, the 1883 placement very effectively eliminates the possibility of the Mill Race Bridge obstructing the line. This might support the idea that the Mill Race Bridge changed in the intervening time and either was obstructing the line of 1869 Step 2 in 1883, or perhaps the 1883 surveyor considered the possibility of such an obstruction in the future, and he moved the Place of Beginning accordingly.

## Dowsing

Mike Bishop, the ground penetrating radar technician suggested walking with a "divining rod" to further corroborate the results of the ground penetrating radar, and of course, I was curious. While he admitted that it was a questionable practice, he claimed that it is actually used widely in oil drilling and other domains. It had been raining in the days prior, and he reasoned that the compacted earth of the raceway, filled with rocks, would be a likely channel for water still. 

As I write this, dowsing/divining has long been considered a pseudo-science. It is my understanding that it has not been replicated in controlled scientific tests.

<figure>

> The scientific explanation for what happens when people dowse is that “ideomotor movements” – muscle movements caused by subconscious mental activity – make anything held in the hands move. It looks and feels as if the movements are involuntary. The same phenomenon has been shown to lie behind movements of objects on a Ouija board.

The rod he used was from a "pin flag" identical to the ones used to mark where he had painted the edges of the raceway, as seen in the photographs of the event. The flag had been removed and the rod bent at a ninety degree angle, one side significantly shorter than the other. He walked along the northern edge of Brooktondale Road, from west to east going in the direction of Mills' Store, holding the shorter side of the bent rod in his closed right hand in front of him, the rod pointed east parallel to the road. As he crossed the *previously detected and marked* western edge, the rod began to turn, and by the time he reached the mid point between the two detected edges, the rod had turned fully toward the south and then the southwest, the detected course of the raceway, seemingly verifying what the GPR had detected. 

I asked if I could try, and after brief instruction, I replicated his process described above, and with similar results. I must admit that I only walked from a point several feet west of the western edge detected to a point several feet east of the eastern point detected, but as I crossed the western edge, the rod began to waver, and as I approached the center of the supposed raceway, it swung very definitively to the south and then the southwest as I continued. It certainly seemed to me as though the rod had moved on its own without my influence. If nothing else, it was an amusing episode. 

## The Barn

Another question I often wondered was where the Mills kept horses and/or carriage that they would presumably have owned. The 1912 highway map provides the only evidence of which I am aware that depicts a barn, indicated with a "B" on the map, that presumably was the structure that housed these. 

{{% fig "brookton/maps/1912-highway-bf033282-001-p2-lower-hb" "800" /%}}

There appears to be a symbol of some kind next to the structure that I have yet to be able to identify. 

{{% fig "brookton/maps/1912-highway-barn-close" "500" /%}}

<figure>

> H is House, and B is Barn, (some barns are the modern "garage" and not what some think of as a barn). The mark next to the barn is puzzling, the rest of the map is fairly clean, and there are some other symbols above "John Manderville" at stations 93, 94, 94+75, & 95. So, I would guess that this mark is trying to show something but not sure what, maybe a spring?

John Mandeville is explored further in other sections of this material, but it should be noted that he was known to have consulted on the 1912 highway surveys for Creek (Brooktondale) Road that indicate the barn at that time. 

This barn falls within an area that was later appropriated in the 1960's, and presumably any structure that remained at that time would have been demolished.

I also had the indicated area scanned by ground penetrating radar on 29 Jun 2023, presuming that there might remain buried pieces of a stone foundation, or some kind of soil disturbance or compaction where the barn stood. In that area, there was something detected that was different from the surrounding ground, but nothing definitive could be determined.

Perhaps a future owner of Mills’ Home will try again to locate these structures using better non-invasive technology, more sensitive and more accurate, and perhaps that person will approach the endeavor with a better understanding of what they are looking for, and where, than I have been able to acquire myself.

## Scratch



Because the 1869 and 1883 descriptions use matching bearings for the eastern boundary line, I will initially reconcile the two descriptions by using a Magnetic declination of **6°** for both, based on the table of Magnetic declinations already given, which should be adequate for this purpose. (There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in a degree, so the difference in declination between the two dates is 1° 8', making the midpoint between the two measurements 6° 18' and I further rounded this down to 6° to match the precision of the original measurements, which do not specify minutes or seconds. )

Now 1883, likewise adjusted for Magnetic 6° declination:

And now overlaying Magnetic 1869 and Magnetic 1883 so that Points B and C line up, results in a nearly perfect match, much closer to reconciling than any attempt thus far, and tantalizingly close to closing The Mandeville Triangle:


Also between 1869 and 1883, the wooden trestle was constructed, completed in Dec 1875. Particularly because of the proximity of Mills Home to Brookton Depot, this may have resulted in increased road traffic and also heavier loads, requiring maintenance and perhaps widening of the road.


But what if we align Point B on the True north Mandeville Line with the concrete monument as Rice would have it? Then, if we were to try to shift raceway to the east by a reasonable estimate, to account for a speculated effect from the bend under the road, we do get much closer to aligned centers, although the distance of the apparent mismatch still seems too large to dismiss, even with the imprecision of my crude methods. It also means that every other point on the diagram would be thrown off, so this seems an unlikely interpretation to me. If this were a plausible match, it would obviously suggest an explanation for the positioning of the concrete monument and strongly suggest that the bridge center shifted west significantly. It would also start to give us clues about the bridge structure itself. But ultimately, with only the evidence of the raceway, and no direct knowledge of the bridge itself, this is all speculation.



There is still the open question of     

Where does this leave us in the end? Although I have examined all of the surveys and legal descriptions to get a deeper understanding of them and the history of the property, when it comes to knowing where the Mills' Home property lines should correctly fall.Of the two possible correct interpretations I can't say for certain, but I will talk in terms of probabilities instead, and of course, at some point, a different kind of calculation has to be made if we consider how any past mistakes made during the tenure of previous owners should be corrected among the current owners. 

First,  to be clear on our goal, which is not to reconcile every survey or even explain aspects of individual surveys that seemingly lack explanation, although I have tried to do to gain a deeper understanding of the home’s history. Our goal is to come to a correct interpretation of the 1869 deed description, the supposed Mandeville Survey, because as I write this, no intentional change to 1869 has ever been made. The eastern line that defines Tract III was created to correct an obvious error  . 1869 appears to be self-consistent and correct, that is to say, there are no apparent defects. The only question then is whether its bearings are Magnetic or True. And recall that as this implies, 

And after pealing back the actions over the years, it is clear that at the bottom, each interpretation has exactly one piece of evidence supporting it.

For the Magnetic interpretation, there is the 1883 description, which is a complete mis-match with True 1869, but tightly matches–with one exception easily explained away–a Magnetic 1869. The 1883 surveyor clearly interpreted 1869 as Magnetic. Also note, **1883 was the first to make this determination** because even though Dalebrook was sold in 1877, that deed description does not define the Mandeville Line in any way, but instead encompasses the entire area and simply says “excepting and reserving herefrom the land heretofore conveyed by Jacob Vandemark and Charles W. Personius to Wm. B. Wolcott” (Caroline Deeds 2, p510), implicitly relying on Mills’ Home 1869. So, it seems 1883 had the first opportunity to interpret 1869, and was presumably in the best position time-wise to interpret it correctly. 

For the True north interpretation, everything hinges on the [Old Iron Pipe]({{% relref "#the-old-iron-pipe" %}}) (OIP). It is clearly intended to fall on the True north Mandeville Line, but we don’t know who put it there or when. Its theoretically possible that it was put there in 1869, and 1883 simply missed it, although I think that is an unlikely theory. Assuming the OIP was placed If this is not the case, then a reasonable argument could be made that 1883 affirms a Magnetic interpretation of 1869, and therefore anything that is incompatible with with either of these years is in error, including the placement of the OIP. What can be said is that it influenced Rice in 1969 and by extension, everyone after him.

This still leaves us with the surviving physical evidence of the raceway. But this is evidence has many caveats. We are warned on page 2 of the report that “GPR imagery was very poor on the asphalt”, the exact area in question. But even if the instruments accurately detected everything, the technician’s interpretation of the readings, and his placement of markers are all accurate, it tells us only about the raceway and not the bridge structure, which is what the legal descriptions actually reference. Because we have no direct knowledge of the Mill Race Bridge’s placement and construction, I have had to make the simplifying assumption that the raceway center approximates the Mill Race Bridge center. But considering the GPR evidence, which shows both a widening and a bend under the road, it is difficult to say how accurate this might be. 

Furthermore, this obviously only gives us of the raceway at the end of its useful life, which is especially important to consider in light of the fact that **the GPR data does not line up with any Mills’ Home or Dalebrook deed description or survey**. Because it is uncorroborated by **any** other evidence, **the GPR data seems to offer no evidence in support of any of the legal descriptions or survey maps**. This means, unfortunately, it must be set aside.

But how do we explain *that* fact? Why doens’t the GPR data match any of the other evidence? The logical conclusion is that something has moved. But, because Magnetic 1869 and Magnetic 1883 match, it means that *none of the commons points changed*, implying that any change must be to a landmark. I have provided many pieces of evidence showing that the road did not change position or course over time (although it presumably widened, but the center orientation mitigates any effects). This leaves us with one option, which the GPR data *could* provide indirect evidence for, that the Mill Race Bridge itself shifted over time.

[TODO: add raceway info]

But if we assume that the Mill Race Bridge *must* have shifted, couldn’t this also explain the discrepancy between True 1869 and True 1883? While that could offer an easy explanation for the apparent mismatch between Mill Race Bridge centers in that interpretation, it doesn’t account for the mismatch between B and C in True 1869 and True 1883, and also doesn’t explain the fact that True 1869 (as it has been traditionally placed relative to True 1883) does not intersect the OIP, and the OIP is the crucial piece of evidence supporting a True north interpretation in the first place.

I therefore believe that the evidence suggests that the Magnetic north Mandeville Line is the more likely interpretation to be correct.


Tract III appears to be an attempt to reconcile Rice's Broken Line, which may be indirectly based on a perceived incompatibility with 1869 and 1883. Either way, it is clear there is no basis for its existence. That land has always been part of The Wolcott Lot.

This makes sense 



A Dalebrook appropriation map from 1963 suggests the possibility that the mill race bridge was significantly to the east of the boundary line between Mills' Home and Dalebrook.

## Further Research

Throughout this investigation, I have tried to get the assistance of surveyors and engineers to help interpret my findings, but this has been somewhat difficult, which is why I felt compelled to make my own survey maps and measurements. 

The following are questions and proposed areas of further exploration and as I continue to investigate, and I will update this documentation as I learn more.

  - What other factors might be evidence, either for or against, of 1869 and 1883 bearings being Magnetic? What was common practice then?

  - Is it possible that in the 1800's the bridge was built diagonally to the road such that the abutments did not fall on a line perpendicular to the road? Or would the bridge be square with the road (and substantially wider). Does the center of the bridge align with the center of the raceway itself? How might this have affected the choice of Place of Beginning in 1869 and 1883? (Step 2 in 1869 might at one time or another have been obstructed by the bridge structure on the northern side of the road.) 

  - Was it the *intention* that the concrete highway monument near the road be placed at Point B? If so, what can we say about the accuracy of its placement? What is the basis for its placement? Is it just an approximation of Point B, or is it unrelated? Do other highway surveys exist that accurately record its location in a way that can be verified against the property deeds? 

  - On Dresser, was the Old Iron Pipe itself measured and accurately placed on the map at scale? If so, what are the distances: 1) between C and OIP and 2) between OIP and B?

  - The distance “71 links” seems to  surfaces a number of times

  1. The width of the house is roughly equal to the difference in Places of Beginning in the True vs Magnetic interpretations of Mandeville.

R818 and guard rail on 1912 highway maps? 

------
A potential clue that would constrain the timeframe of the OIP’s existence and confirm that it was truly “old” by the time of Rice and Miller, is that a line perpendicular to the road that intersects the OIP falls close to the GPR detected eastern side of the raceway channel on the northern side of the road:


Regardless of the exact construction of the bridge, we can assume that the structure would extended significantly to the east of the eastern edge of the raceway, and this may have provided a visual landmark for the placement of the OIP. If this were the case, the OIP would obviously pre-date the closing of the grist mill described above. Based on deed dates for Dalebrook and Mills’ Home, it seems more likely that it would have been placed by a Mills’ Home surveyor at some point, thereby favoring the True north interpretation of the Mandeville Line.

Another apparent coincidence is that this line also tracks the eastern face of the current shed, which was built by the Lattins in the 1980’s. If there was a prior structure there (and at that angle!), I am unaware of it.

At some point, new scans should be done, as the technology is expected to advance, and the scan should include both sides of Brooktondale Road, all the way down to Dalebrook/Mills' Store, so that any evidence for or against an altered course can be found. And the raceway should at least be mapped to its origins at Dalebrook for complete understanding of it. 

The most obvious question is what would the standard practice have been in 1869 and 1883?

(The concrete marker on the brow of the hill indicated on the survey maps, starting with the first in 1969, is a concrete highway monument that, based on its location, was put in place in conjunction with the 26 Jan 1966 Appropriate Map shown above.)




Note that Step 3 is identical in each, implying the start point and end point in each are referring to the same respective physical points in space, and note further that in the 1869 description, the lines indicated in Steps 2 and 3 form a right angle, allowing us to easily derive measurements not explicitly given. 

Also note that Steps 2 and 3 are intended to convey a straight line from the center of the road to the Point C on the brow of the hill in the northeastern corner of the parcel. 

The concrete highway monument on the brow of the hill, placed there in 1966  after the second appropriation and present as I write this, is the general area where the photographer of the following photograph of the "Great Iron Bridge at Brookton" stood with his camera. A version of this photograph can be found on page 57 in *The Towns of Tompkins County: From Podunk to the Magnetic Springs* edited by Jane Marsh Dieckmann, that states it was taken in 1907, the last year of Edward Mills' life. 

{{% fig "trestle/trestle_postcard" "800" /%}}


Point C is replicated in three other property deeds, with their own independent measurements fixing that point, ultimately to other landmarks. It would be measured more often than any other point on the line, and would be the most likely to be clearly marked as a result. So, while the placement of Point B shifts based on True bearings vs. Magnetic, *Point C does not*. Point C is a constant used to reconcile all maps and descriptions under all interpretations.

For these reasons, Point C is a more practical "Place of Beginning" when it comes to reconciling 1869. If Point C can be accurately located, and the bearings and distance measurements are accurate, 1883 and anyone else should be able to reproduce 1869 to a high degree of accuracy using the description alone. Even if landmarks had shifted, 1883 would arrive back at the original points in space.

How would 1869 and 1883 accurately know Magnetic declination so they could both adjust to True North?

1883 could have adjusted his recorded compass bearings to match 1869 *without* knowing Magnetic declination, if the surveyor of 1869 left behind markers at Points C and B. 1883 could then take a baseline compass bearing of the line itself and adjust his measured bearings to match 1869. Maybe 1883 did exactly that. This would again allow him to exactly reproduce 1869, returning to the same physical points in space despite differences in Magnetic declination or shifted landmarks, as long as his measurements were accurate.

(And notice that the proposed baseline compass bearing be they would have to be specifically with those two points, its really the only opportunity to do so without resorting to a landmark that may have shifted.) 


The property surveys presented are to my knowledge a complete accounting of all property surveys for both Mills' Home and Dalebrook. 
 


Some further implications: I will show evidence gathered in 2023 from [ground penetrating radar scans]({{% relref "#echoes-of-the-tailrace" %}}) that the course of the tailrace and therefore, the location of the Mill Race Bridge must have moved quite substantially between 1883 and 1912. This must be the case with either a True or Magnetic interpretation of 1869, but the distance is even more pronounced from Magnetic 1869, and the approximate distance of that shift can be deduced from the evidence, as I will show in that later section.  



----



Ultimately, the centerpoint of a landmark, even the convergence of landmarks such as Point A, must be determined by human judgement. Point C is only different in that there is a larger set of possible points upon which judgement can rest. Point D is also landmark based, possibly guided by a fence, it is the center of the road, where it intersects the line from the brow of the hill, and while this might be hard to judge today, I would propose that the most logical place to start is the mid point... [TODO] 

Conceptually, the center of the Mill Race Bridge at the center of Creek Road is a definite and precise point, but when it comes to actually measuring it in physical space, we must judge exactly there we are starting from, and we have to acknowledge that the most we can say about 1883's choice of Point A is that (assuming the bridge had not changed) it is within inches of Mandeville's judgement of the point in 1869. Any difference is carried forward and accumulates as each point is in turn judged. 

But clearly, it was 1883's intention to close Mandeville's Triangle, and mathematically, there is more than one way to do this. 

1883 could have simply verified Mandeville's Survey and replicated it, but he specifically chose a new PoB. Why did he do this, and what are the implications for interpreting his measurements?




If he starts at Point C, he is off by one angle, he will miss Point B, and the PoB will also be off by *at least* the same degree.


The most logical starting point is the apparent starting point, Point A. This is after all, explicitly how we are told the lot is defined, so even if he approached from C, which we cannot know, the intention is to start from the Place of Beginning. And this should not be a problem for 1883 because he believes he has replicated 1869 and described the same points in space faithfully.

It is clearly the intention of 1883 that the location of what I have called Point A match the same in 1869. So now we retrace his steps and walk down the center of Creek Road until his compass bearing in 1883 matches 1869, and the distance to that point is measured at 82 links. But due to Magnetic declination, he has gone too far, and taken the measurement is off by one degree, therefore, he then moves north, away from the road at the wrong angle. He misses Point B, that measure is also wrong.  to identify the same location in sPoint A is the same


DESPITE MISSING B HE GETS BACK TO C in 1883



From a purely mathematical standpoint, C strikes me as a more logical "Place of Beginning" than the one chosen. 

Further recognize that assuming the Mandeville Survey was accurately measured (and we correctly adjust for Magnetic declination), then Point C is the only point we need to locate to completely and accurately derive all other Mandeville points in 1869. This means that even if every other landmark shifted in that time period, we can still be confident of finding every point on the survey in their approximate former locations in physical space.  



I have had this nagging feeling that 1883 has additional clues to uncover, but in the end, I concluded that I was attributing unnecessary cleverness to the surveyor, cleverness that is not only unnecessary, but its addition only detracts from the clarity of the survey, and I think that is the starting point of the most likely explanation for the 1883 PoB. He deviated from 1869 to be conceptually simpler, so he did exactly what it appears he did: starting at the convergence of two landmarks at Point A, he started from the center of the Mill Race Bridge and walked east down the center of Creek Road until his compass reading matched that of the Mandeville , .


. 
I have tried to find a mathematical explanation for the 1883 PoB, an d



But what about Mandeville's choices, particularly in regard to the Place of Beginning? I believe this mainly boils down to the placement of Point B, the point that fixes the Mandeville Line. It does not seem to be an accidental coincidence that it forms a 90 degree angle, and by setting Point B off the road, he has mitigated the effects of any future changes to the road. 

But knowing this angle doesn't explain why Point B was placed where it was. (I am assuming it was intentionally chosen for a logical reason and not an arbitrarily chosen point.) For example, why wasn't the line from Point C to the center of the Creek Road set at 90 degrees to begin with?  Why was nine degrees chosen instead? 

It seems to me that despite how it is described by Mandeville, the initial plotting of the lines of the lot most logically would have started at Point C. Understand that Point C's location was not arbitrarily chosen: it is a landmark, and further, a landmark in a corner of the property, and so, it fits the general characteristics of a typical Place of Beginning in the Metes and Bounds approach. An angle to Point B was chosen, and then the Place of Beginning was placed where a 90 degree line intersects the center of Creek Road, which was then measured back to Point A, the center of the Mill Race Bridge. So the question now is, why was the angle from Point C, which determines the placement of Point B chosen as it was.


But despite overshooting the 1883 PoB due to a one degree difference in 
Point B is the only point on either 1869 or 1883 that is not directly referenced by at least one landmark.

## The Mill Race Bridge as a Property Landmark

The goal of this section is to correctly interpret the two Mills' Home deed descriptions from the 1800's. These descriptions described the property for more than two decades after Emily died.  

As the documents that follow will show, Brooktondale Road's previous names and designations included: Creek Road, Cooks Corners-Brookton Highway, Brooktondale-Ithaca Highway, New York State Route 330, and Tompkins County Route No. 115.

The first deed for Mills' Home as a separate parcel divided from the grist mill lot, was given to William Benton Wolcott in 1869, and was appropriately called "The Wolcott Lot" at the time. The Tompkins County Clerks Office was kind enough to provide me with two scans of the deed that I present here as each is clearer in areas that the other is not:

{{% fig "mills-home/caroline-deeds-1-572-alt-scan" "350" /%}}
</div>

The transcribed legal property description: 

<figure>

> Being a part of the grist mill lot and bounded as follows. **Beginning in the center of the Creek road, 71 links westerly from the center of the bridge over the race from the grist mill** and running thence south 81 degrees east 1 chain and 43 links to a stake; thence north nine degrees east, four chains & twenty links to the brow of the hill. Thence westerly along said brow of hill to the center of the aforesaid "Creek road". Thence easterly along said center of road three chains & ten links to the place of beginning.

This and subsequent deed deed descriptions use the metes and bounds system and quadrantal compass bearings. 

<figure>

> Prior to the Revolutionary War, when land was surveyed, the “metes and bounds” system was used to define boundaries. The system is still in existence today for land which was acquired before the present system of surveying land was adopted. States which used this form of surveying were the thirteen original colonies (Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia) as well as the state land states Hawaii, Kentucky, Maine, Texas, Tennessee, Vermont, West Virginia and parts of Ohio.
>
> In a metes and bounds land description, there is a starting point which is always at a corner. This is followed by directions and measurement which may be written in a variety of ways, indicating a line leading to the next corner. **The corners will generally be a physical feature.** Often the property owners will be mentioned who bound the land being described.

In conjunction with using landmarks as boundaries, it seems to have been common practice to measure landmarks from their centers, presumably to choose a more stable reference point, thus mitigating variations over time, such as the growth of trees, the widening of roads, etc. In the Mills' Home deeds and surveys, this practice is used in relation to Brooktondale Road, the mill race bridge, and the large oak tree on the hill. The references to the center of the road are implicit in the Mills' Home deeds, but explicit in the corresponding Dalebrook deed descriptions.

Although I do not see the name of the surveyor in 1869 documented, it was likely [John L. Mandeville](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/67292637/john-mandeville) (1836 to 29 Nov 1907), the grandson of [Reverend Garrett Mandeville](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/65244680/garrett-mandeville) (18 May 1775 to 11 Dec 1853), who was the minister of the Dutch Reformed Church for 25 years. John Mandeville was a Civil War veteran and a founding member of the [Congregational Church of Mott's Corners]({{% relref "founding-documents" %}}). He is listed as "surveyor" on the 1866 Stone & Steward map of Mott's Corners, a portion of which was shown above, and he advocated for and consulted on the 1912 highway improvements already explored above, although he died before he could see the work completed. For more information, see [John Mandeville and The Good Roads Movement]({{% relref "#john-mandeville-and-the-good-roads-movement" %}}). Obviously, I can't prove that John Mandeville was the 1869 surveyor, but for the purposes of this exploration, I will suppose that he was. 

With the next Mills' Home deed in 1883, a new Place of Beginning relative to the Mill Race Bridge was established, and this description remained unchanged until Jessie Brewer sold the property to the Jones family. The difference in measurement suggests the surveyor of 1883 may have been someone other than the surveyor of 1869. But as I will show, without this new Place of Beginning, we would not know how to correctly interpret these deed descriptions.

To understand the measurements given in the descriptions above:

<div class="cols">

<figure style="width: 350px">

> The chain is a unit of length equal to 66 feet (22 yards), used in both the US customary and Imperial unit systems. It is subdivided into 100 links or 4 rods. There are 10 chains in a furlong, and 80 chains in one statute mile. In metric terms, it is 20.1168 m long. By extension, chainage (running distance) is the distance along a curved or straight survey line from a fixed commencing point, as given by an odometer.

> Gunter's chain (also known as Gunter's measurement) is a distance measuring device used for surveying. It was designed and introduced in 1620 by English clergyman and mathematician Edmund Gunter (1581–1626). It enabled plots of land to be accurately surveyed and plotted, for legal and commercial purposes. 
>
>...Gunter's chain reconciled two seemingly incompatible systems: the traditional English land measurements, based on the number four, and decimals based on the number 10. Since an acre measured 10 square chains in Gunter's system, the entire process of land area measurement could be computed using measurements in chains, and then converted to acres by dividing the results by 10.[2] Hence 10 chains by 10 chains (100 square chains) equals 10 acres, 5 chains by 5 chains (25 square chains) equals 2.5 acres. By the 1670s the chain and the link had become statutory units of measurement in England.

## John Mandeville and The Good Roads Movement


John L. Mandeville was first cousins with Dr. Martin Besemer. John's mother, [Almira A. (Hutchinson) Mandeville](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/67292502/almira_a_mandeville) (06 Mar 1810 to 06 Apr 1885) is the sister of Dr. Besemer's mother [Joanna (Hutchinson) Besemer](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/97408656/joanna_besemer) (02 Sep 1812 to 19 Jun 1853).

Motts Corners was the largest of these settlements, with a population of three hundred.

  - "Macadam is a type of road construction pioneered by Scottish engineer John Loudon McAdam around 1820, in which crushed stone is placed in shallow, convex layers and compacted thoroughly. A binding layer of stone dust (crushed stone from the original material) may form; it may also, after rolling, be covered with a cement or bituminous binder to keep dust and stones together. The method simplified what had been considered state-of-the-art at that point. ...McAdam's renown is his effective and economical construction, which was a great improvement over the methods used by his generation. He emphasized that roads could be constructed for any kind of traffic, and he helped to alleviate the resentment travelers felt toward increasing traffic on the roads. His legacy lies in his advocacy of effective road maintenance and management. He advocated a central road authority with trained professional officials who could be paid a salary that would keep them from corruption. These professionals could give their entire time to these duties and be held responsible for their actions." ([Wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macadam), Wikipedia.org.)

> The Good Roads Movement occurred in the United States between the late 1870s and the 1920s. It was the rural dimension of the Progressive movement. A key player was the United States Post Office Department. Once a commitment was made for Rural Free Delivery of the mail, the Post Office had to determine which local roads were suitable and which were not. Farmers living on officially unusable roads now had motivation to get them upgraded. Advocates for improved roads turned local agitation into a national political movement. It started as a coalition between farmers' organizations groups and bicyclists' organizations, such as the League of American Wheelmen. The goal was state and federal spending to improve rural roads. By 1910, automobile lobbies such as the American Automobile Association joined the campaign, coordinated by the National Good Roads Association.
>
> Outside cities, roads were dirt or gravel; mud in the winter and dust in the summer. Travel was slow and expensive. Early organizers cited Europe where road construction and maintenance was supported by national and local governments. In its early years, the main goal of the movement was education for road building in rural areas between cities and to help rural populations gain the social and economic benefits enjoyed by cities where citizens benefited from railroads, trolleys and paved streets. Even more than traditional vehicles, the newly invented bicycles could benefit from good country roads.

> During the 19th century, cities usually had decent roads, but rural roads were often little more than muddy trails. Bicyclists and railroad companies began calling for good roads in the 1880s, but American road building really took off in the 20th century as a response to rising numbers of cars and trucks.

> A majority of Americans still lived in rural areas in the early twentieth century, but operating a motor vehicle there was nearly impossible because of poor-quality—or nonexistent—roads. Consequently, most vehicles were purchased by people living in cities, where streets were paved. Roads in rural areas served primarily as feeders into train stations. A few miles from stations, roads would terminate at streams or county lines or simply disappear into the mud. The cost of hauling grain ten miles from farm to station by road was higher than the cost of hauling it five hundred or one thousand miles by train to big-city markets. It could take an entire day to travel twenty miles in a rural area.

Based on the deed descriptions of 1869 and 1883 given above, I have attempted to create my own rudimentary “pseudo-survey” maps. I should point out that my knowledge of surveying methods is self-taught, so my efforts should be evaluated accordingly.  

Going forward, I will assume that both descriptions refer to the following (approximate) common points in space:

<figure>

| Point |  | Description  |
| --: | --- | --- |
| **A** |  | The center of the Mill Race Bridge (Mill Race Bridge). It seems implied that this is simultaneously the center of Creek Road, and further analysis below will confirm this. |
| **B** |  | Because the measurement in Step 3 of both descriptions is the same distance and bearing from the common point (C) below, the stake referred to in Step 2 of both descriptions is the same object at the same point in space. |
| **C** | | The brow of the hill in the northeastern corner of the property. | 
| **D** | | The center of Creek Road at the southern, lower end of the "brow of the hill". This point disappears with appropriations in the 1960's. | 

</figure>

These points as well as the five steps in the deed descriptions will be labelled on my pseudo-surveys.

I based the orientation of my maps on the course of Brooktondale Road, which is an essential landmark, along with the Mill Race Bridge, for establishing the Place of Beginning of the Mills' Home parcel. The portion of Brooktondale Road that runs in front of Mills' Home has always been represented on maps as a perfectly straight line in the same location. For example, both the 1866 Stone & Stewart Atlas and the 1912 Highway map corroborate this, showing that the road only begins to gradually curve toward Dalebrook beginning east of the Mills parcel. This curve was itself straightened in the mid 1960's when the lower bridge was reconstructed. All of the Mills' Home property survey maps corroborate this, as do other maps.

{{% fig "brookton/maps/1938-brooktondale-inset" "800" /%}}

On 06 Mar 2023, at my request and witnessed by me, a new survey of Mills' Home was created that presumably provides the most accurate measurements to date, as it was the first to use laser measurement instead of tape. This survey shows the straight portion of Brooktondale Road in front of Mills' Home bearing **N 53° 14' 53" W Magnetic**.

For more direct comparison, I will convert all bearings from Magnetic to True north (hereafter simply "True"). To determine Magnetic declination–the difference between Magnetic north and True north based on geographic position and time–I will use geographic coordinates derived from the physical address 475 Brooktondale Road, Brooktondale NY 14817: **42° 22' 56" N, 76° 23' 53" W** (42.38215534534776, -76.39793472910708).

Then, using the document dates for the relevant deeds and survey maps that will be considered, I obtained the following Magnetic declination values from the National Centers for Environmental Information Geomagnetic Calculator at ngdc.noaa.gov, using the IGRF2020 model.

Using the bearings given for Brooktondale/Creek Road in the sources above and adjusting for the indicated Magnetic declination further shows that they all essentially reconcile.

– Recorded bearings for Brooktondale/Creek Road, taken from historical deeds and surveys available from Tompkins County Clerk, Ithaca NY.

  - All data are for 475 Brooktondale Road, "Mills' Home", except for 26 Feb 1912, a Tompkins County highway survey, and 07 Apr 1972 which is for the adjoining property at 487 Brooktondale Road, Dalebrook Apartments, and 

  - Using quadrant bearings, the bearing in the opposite direction is the mirror image of the given bearing, so that N xx° yy' W is equivalent to S xx° yy' E in the opposite direction. This is the basis for the "Normalized Bearing" column. 

  - The 1972 and 2023 measurements are explicitly labelled Magnetic on their surveys. 

  - I do not see an explicit notation for the 1969 and 1980 measurements, but Schlieder's recorded bearings for Brooktondale Road and the eastern boundary line with Dalebrook at those times clearly shows he corrected for magnetic declination. This is further confirmed in the overlaid surveys below. 
 
</figcaption>
</figure>

Neither 1869 nor 1883 give a specific bearing for Creek Road, but because the road has not changed course and location over those years, the two surveys should at least match. Based on the above analysis, I will assume a bearing of **N 64° 30' W True north** for Creek Road in the 1869 and 1883 legal descriptions, allowing them to reconcile.

For simplicity, I will represent the path of the brow of the hill in Step 4 as a straight line. The endpoint of the line on the road is determined relative to the measured distance from the Place of Beginning in Step 5.

For distances, I chose to scale my maps so that 1 inch is equal to 1 chain, which was a very practical size for me to work with and made creating the lines much easier, as then links translates directly into a percentage of an inch. For example, a distance of “4 chains and 63 links” equals 4.63 inches on my full-size pseudo-surveys. Obviously, the versions shown on this page are scaled down for this format, but the full-size originals (at a resolution of 300 DPI) are available via the accompanying links.

Although neither the 1869 nor the 1883 deed descriptions specify True or Magnetic north, I will demonstrate that both use Magnetic bearings, as that is the only way to reconcile them. So, the given bearings will need to be adjusted accordingly. Referring back to the table of Magnetic declinations given above, the difference of Magnetic declination between 1869 and 1883 is 1° 8', which as I will show, is quite significant. In other words, we should expect that the common points between them, particularly B and C, *will* be significantly different, but they should converge on stable landmarks like the Mill Race Bridge. 

Recall there are 60 minutes in a degree, so rounding the 1869 declination of 5° 44' to 6° is reasonable, and similarly, rounding the 1883 declination of 6° 52' to 7° is reasonable and gives us the rounded difference sought of 1°, or 1° 8' rounded to the nearest whole degree to align the precision used those years. 

The 1869 Mills' home deed description, adjusted for 6° Magnetic declination:

I overlaid my 1869 pseudo-survey on the 2023 Dresser survey that has also been adjusted to True north for its specific Magnetic declination so that the road on each survey is parallel. To match the scale, I lined up the center-line of the road, which has been established as a stable landmark throughout all the referenced deeds and surveys, and scaled Dresser until it overlapped Point C on my pseudo-survey in the northeast corner of the brow of the hill, a point that also appears to be consistently located over the years. Admittedly, this is a crude approach, but it is adequate to explore the location of the Mill Race Bridge.  


The two pseudo-surveys thus adjusted and overlaid brings Points A very close together, clearly indicating a match.


It becomes even clearer how closely the Magnetic interpretations match when attempting to close The Mandeville Triangle using the Pythagorean Theorem. In the calculations below, compatible but unitless values will be used, so that for example, 1 chain and 43 links can be represented unitlessly as 1.43. Combining Steps 1 from 1869 and 1883 gives us the following expected value of the hypotenuse of Mandeville's Triangle:

<figure>

&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.71 (from 1869 Step 1)

&plus; 0.82  (from 1883 Step 1)

-----
 
= 1.53 expected hypotenuse 

</figure> 

Now calculating the hypotenuse using the measurements given for the other two sides of Mandeville's Triangle shows less than a 2 foot difference between Points A in 1869 and 1883:

<figure>

&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.43<sup>2</sup> = 2.0449 (from 1869 Step 2)

&plus; 0.63<sup>2</sup> = 0.3969 (from 1883 Step 2)

-----

= 2.4418

&radic; 2.4418 = 1.56

1.56 - 1.53 = 3

3 links  x 7.92 inches = 23.76 inches or 1.98 feet. 

</figure> 

If the 1883 surveyor did not check his math, I can understand: he would have had to calculate square roots manually, whereas I have not.

Magnetic 1869 and 1883 not only match more points more closely, but the mismatches are smaller than those of the True interpretations and are more easily explained by any number of mundane reasons. 

Point C is used for alignment and B is off because of the difference in magnetic declination. Point D is actually a match because its location is in strict lockstep with Point A. If Point A is off, Point D must be off in the same direction and to the same degree, otherwise, it would be in error.

The two feet at Point A can be attributed to a number of factors. Aside from the difference in Magnetic declination, we are likely dealing with two different surveyors using different equipment which may be calibrated differently. And because the precision of the measurements is low–whole links and degrees–simple differences in rounding could be to blame.

Now consider the road. As discussed in relation to the Good Roads Movement, in 1869 and 1883, we can assume the road is dirt/mud and there would be no markings, such as the painted center lines present as I write this, so how precisely can the mid-point of the road be replicated over the distance between the two Places of Beginning?

If the road widened in the intervening time, say because of increased traffic after the Dec 1875 completion of the wooden trestle and associated depot at Mott's Corners, then depending on *how* it widened (either the northern side of the road, the southern side, or both, may have shifted) this could shift the center line of the road, and because the angle of the Mandeville Line to the road is not perpendicular, the effect of the changes could have outsized effects on the location of the center point.

To illustrate this last point, realize that as you move down the Mandeville Line toward the road you are moving at an angle three degrees to the *west*. Second, the raceway itself flows to the southwest at an even greater degree, and if Point A tracks it, then every step you take to the southwest along the Mandeville Line, Point A moves even further southwest relative to you. Consider the following, which for simplicity, shows the relationship to a vertical line:


This difference would then propagate to Point D as expected. In other words, I don't think there is evidence for a significant shift in the location of Point A between 1869 and 1883, at least in these descriptions.

Clearly **the only way to reconcile 1869 and 1883 is to interpret them Magnetically**. Therefore, **the 1883 pseudo-survey is the best estimate of Point A, the center of the Mill Race Bridge, that can be made with the evidence given**.

One immediate implication is represented by the solid blue line in the adjusted diagram. This is based on measurements from Miller and Schlieder that give the distance of the True Mandeville Line as "320' total to cl road" which is equivalent to four chains and 85 links, just two links greater than the distance given in 1883 Steps 2 and 3, of 4 chains and 83 links. The solid blue line therefore represents the (incorrect) True 1883 measurements, implying that if the road center line is the same then as now, the original location of Point C was slightly to the south.  

The Magnetic interpretation clearly proves 1883's bearings as recorded in the relevant deed description are Magnetic, and it further indicates that the surveyor in 1883 understood 1869 to also be Magnetic. One might be tempted to conclude that this is as far as we can go, that 1883 may have been mistaken in his interpretation of 1869 as Magnetic, but that can't be correct. Regardless of where in physical space the respective Places of Beginning fall, it does not change the fact that in 1869, the Place of Beginning was measured physically 71 links west of the center of the Mill Race Bridge, and an independent measurement in 1883 puts its Place of Beginning physically 82 links east of the center of the Mill Race Bridge. The mere fact that Magnetic 1883 identifies this same landmark, in the same location, as Magnetic 1869, proves that **1869 must also be Magnetic**.

Magnetic 1869 and 1883 on Dresser shows the Mill Race Bridge center falls on a line perpendicular to the road that also approximately intersects a utility pole present in 2023:


Magnetic 1869 and 1883 on Miller shows the center of the Mill Race Bridge intersects the concrete highway monument on a line perpendicular to the road:


1883 also suggests that at that time, the road apparently does not yet begin to curve toward Dalebrook (the grist mill) until some point after the 1883 Place of Beginning. 

 
## The Modern Surveys

The 1869 pseudo-survey in which the steps and points described above are indicated: 


I overlaid my 1869 pseudo-survey on the 2023 Dresser survey that has also been adjusted to True north for its specific Magnetic declination so that the road on each survey is parallel. To match the scale, I lined up the center-line of the road, which has been established as a stable landmark throughout all the referenced deeds and surveys, and scaled Dresser until it overlapped Point C on my pseudo-survey in the northeast corner of the brow of the hill, a point that also appears to be consistently located over the years. Admittedly, this is a crude approach, but it is adequate to explore the location of the Mill Race Bridge.  


A dark blue, thick, dashed line drawn perpendicular to Brooktondale Road, suggests that the place of beginning in 1869 is roughly aligned with the southwestern corner of the original (and still current) foundation of Mills' Home. The center of the mill race bridge falls on a line perpendicular to the road that falls just to the east of the stone patio steps. I verified with Lee Dresser that the structures on the Mills' Home lot, including the patio and shed, are all accurate to scale. In his words "those measurements [for the structures] were all verified with lines of sight from the front control".


On Dresser, the bump in the stone patio under the southwest corner of the shed is a planter area, and the steps are a few feet to the west of that, recessed into the stone patio, as the following photo will show:
 
{{% fig "adams-photos/mill-race/2021-11-09_14.35.54" "800" /%}}

My 1869 pseudo-survey appears to be consistent with Dresser, with Points C and B closely matched. Going forward, I will call the original 1869 eastern boundary line, described in Step 3 between Points B and C as **The Mandeville Line**. Note also that Steps 2 and 3 form a right angle, and I will eventually demonstrate how to close it properly. I will call this area **The Mandeville Triangle**. 

In 1883, a new place of beginning is chosen, this time to the east of the center of the mill race bridge. 


The 1883 pseudo-survey was also overlaid onto the 2023 Dresser survey, using the same method for matching the scale as described above for the 1869 pseudo-survey. 


1883 doesn't line up nearly as well against Dresser as 1869, and the Dresser survey had to be adjusted to a different size for 1869 and 1883 to fit Point C and the center of Creek Road. The center line of the Mill Race Bridge has shifted, and Point B no longer falls near the bent pipe on the Highway Line. The differences between the two pseudo-surveys is clarified by overlaying them onto each other so that the road and the center of the Mill Race Bridge align (and so, assuming that the center of the bridge itself has not moved, which I will later prove), it shows that Points B and C both shift to the same extent, forming parallel eastern boundary lines that differ by roughly 18 links or approximately 12 feet. 


In other words, 1869 and 1883 appear to be mathematically incompatible: we are unable to close The Mandeville Triangle. I will show a way to reconcile these two maps, but for the moment, I must acknowledge that this 1869/1883 overlay appears to be essentially how the first two deed descriptions have been interpreted by surveyors after 1883, as I will now show.

The Mills' Home Place of Beginning as it was described in 1883, 82 links east of the center of the mill race bridge, would remain the legal description even after the mill race disappeared and Emily Mills had died. An exact mirror of this description of the eastern boundary line can be found in the grist mill/Dalebrook deeds in that same time period. 

{{% fig "brookton/maps/475-brookton/235-85" "800" /%}}

Note how this description clarifies that both Places of Beginning in 1869 and 1883, as well as the center of the mill race bride, are in the center of Creek Road, as it specifies that the extended Mandeville Line in 1883 reaches "the center of the creek road at a point 82 links easterly from the center of the bridge crossing the old mill tailrace"

As the 1912 road improvements advocated by John Mandeville were being planned, the grist mill ceased operation and eventually the mill race was filled in.

When he died in 1934, Dr. Mary Rigway, who had grown up in the Willseyville Valley, took over his practice. She later married Dr. Martin Tinker and moved her practice to a house down the street, where it remains.

The first was built by Mott, (e). The last mill was owned by the Vorhis Brothers, and they demolished all but the roof. They took all the materials to Candor to build a stable for a Dr.’s horses. The roof sat over the cellar, and Edbert McMaster and Earl Lupton had a garage here in the 1920’s. Dr. Lockwood had the apartments built, raising the roof and building beneath it. This was about the time that Brookton became Brooktondale.

(As I write this, the area between Dalebrook and Mills' Home as well as the area between the Andersson's and the Todi's remain empty.)

In the mid-1960’s massive roadwork was done through Brooktondale that straightened the road. The following highway survey describes a section of the Dalebrook lot near the common boarder with Mills' Home that was appropriated for the "proposed improvements" and it shows the old mill tailrace as a "covered mill race":

{{% fig "brookton/maps/BF162361-001-map-565" "800" /%}}

Again, because this is a highway survey, I interpret all structures and property lines to be approximate, and given that the race is described as "covered" and is shown here as perfectly straight, I assume this is meant to be an abstract/conceptual representation meant only to mark the existence of the tailrace and note the general scope and direction of it. As a result, it is difficult to say very much about it, other than it supports Andrea Talmadge's conversation with Carl English. However, it is intriguing that it seems to indicate the mill race bridge was on the Dalebrook side of the common boundary as it is represented here. There is a non-zero chance that this could be the case, as I will show in an alternate interpretation of the 1869 and 1883 deed descriptions.

> When the Brooktondale Fire Company celebrated its first twenty years in 1966, residents were smug about progress since the war. The village had a fire company, natural gas, cable television, consolidated schools, a community center, telephones with direct dialing (no toll to Ithaca!), and now was looking forward to getting a safer road for school buses. From 1962 to 1967, Route 330 through Brooktondale was upgraded, for the first time since 1914. The improvements were greater than anyone expected. The Route 79 intersection was totally changed, and the entire road from there to 76 Road was “modernized.” Whole avenues of maples were lost; the abandoned upper mill was subjected to a spectacular “practice burn” in the summer of 1964; the bridge in front of the store was reconfigured. The old Shurter House, which had survived several floods in its day, was bought for one dollar and moved to its present location at 447 Brooktondale Road. Those who objected to the “Rape of Valley Road” complained that the road went nowhere, because it ended at 76 Road.

It was perhaps partially a result of this road work, along with the seeming incompatibilities between the 1869 and 1883 deed descriptions that led Gordon Rice to make an apparent mistake in the very first official survey map of the 475 Brooktondale Road property. Rice mistook a concrete highway marker for a property boundary marker, and used it as a new place of beginning, in a different location than it had specified in both the Mills Home and grist mill/Dalebrook deeds since 1883:

{{% fig "brookton/maps/475-brookton/475-survey-scans/rice" "800" /%}}

What Rice labeled "Con Mon" in the general area of Point B was also round by subsequent surveyors: Thomas G. Miller in a 1972 survey of Dalebrook called it a "H'W'Y MON." and Howard Schlieder in a 1980 survey of Mills' Home called it a "stone mon.". This monument has been consistently placed to the west of the True Mandeville Line.

<div class="cols">
{{% fig "brookton/maps/475-brookton/monument-rice" "200" /%}}

{{% fig "brookton/maps/475-brookton/monument-schlieder" "200" /%}}
</div>

These references to the monument prove that the Rice survey is not self-consistent: Rice and subsequent deed descriptions based on it clearly describe the eastern boundary line as a straight line as it had always been, yet a straight line cannot be drawn that intersects all three points: 1) the iron pipe (IP) at the brow of the hill (Point C), 2) the "**Old Iron Pipe**" in the middle of the hill, and 3) the concrete highway monument near the road. As a result, Rice's eastern boundary line, easily demonstrated to be in error, will be referred to as **Rice's Broken Line**.

When I first moved to Mills' Home, there was a concrete highway marker, still there as I write this, broken off from its base and lying on its side next to the utility pole on the shoulder of Brooktondale Road. While surveying the property in 2023, Lee Dresser attempted to locate the base of the highway monument, in the area of a hedgerow at that time, but he could not find it.

{{% fig "adams-photos/mill-race/2023-07-06_19.23.07a" "800" /%}}

I should also point out that the 2023 Dresser survey states "this survey map prepared without benefit of an abstract of title provided, subject to any state of fact that an updated abstract of title may show." I was present that day and made available the abstract of title, but it was not consulted. Even if it had been, the written description at that time still reflected Rice's Broken Line. 

Miller correctly set a new iron pipe at the road that does fall in a straight line intersecting the other two iron pipes, at a distance 9.5 feet to the east of the concrete highway monument:

{{% fig "brookton/maps/475-brookton/boundary-miller" "200" /%}}

**Miller's line most closely matches the True Mandeville Line drawn on my pseudo-survey above.**

When Howard Schlieder surveyed Mills' Home in 1980, he apparently detected Rice's error and after consulting the Miller survey of Dalebrook to resolve it, he confirmed that Miller was in fact correct. Schlieder corrected Rice's error on the 1980 survey, along with two explicitly clear notes. On the boundary line itself, he noted all three iron pipes, marks the correct line and adds to that line this text: "property line as of survey in Caroline 1970 pg 11"–a direct citation of Miller’s survey of Dalebrook–and confirming that the True Mandeville Line is a roughly 9 degree line as described. He also added a clear footnote stating that Rice and Miller did not agree, and that Miller, "the latter" was correct. 

{{% fig "brookton/maps/475-brookton/475-survey-scans/schlieder" "800" /%}}

(To be very clear, "1970" is not a year, but references a physical volume.)

Notice that the eastern boundary in the Rice survey intersects the large oak tree on the hill, whereas Miller, Schlieder, and Dresser all show the center of the same tree approximately 5 feet west of the boundary line, well within the Mills' Home lot.

Yet Rice's place of beginning lived on in the written legal deed description of Mills' Home:

The area in question was labelled "Tract III" by Schlieder, although I do not see it explicitly referenced as such anywhere else in either the Mills' Home or Dalebrook deeds. I can find only one description of this area at all: in a footnote in the Dalebrook deed at 499/981, Charles C. Vorhis to Frank P. Proto. That deed describes two parcels: 1) Dalebrook and 2) Mills' Store/The Old Postoffice. The description of Dalebrook specifically describes the boundary with Mills' Home relative to Miller's "iron pipe set" next to the road, and explicitly references the Miller survey (1970/11): 

{{% fig "brookton/maps/475-brookton/499-981" "800" /%}}

Then, at the end of the description of "Parcel No. 2", Mills' Store, is an asterisk leading to a footnote at the very end of the document that describes the area of Schlieder's Tract III:

{{% fig "brookton/maps/475-brookton/499-981-triangle" "800" /%}}

The measured distances given correspond to Schlieder's measurements of the dual eastern boundary line.  

To verify this, I once again created a small pseudo-survey based on this description. It is defined by Point C, the iron pipe at the brow of the hill. Recalling that the Magnetic declination in 1972 was 10° 29' W, the following adjustments convert to True bearings for purposes of comparison:

<figure>

| Step | Stated Course | True Course | Converted Distance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| X | N 19° 59' E 320 feet    | N 9° 30' E   | 4 chains 85 links |
| Y | S 10° 44' W 292.05 feet | S 10° 44' W  | 4 chains 43 links | 
| Z | S 53° 33' E             | S 64° 2' E   | 14 links (approx 9.5 feet, from Miller 1970/11) | 

</figure>

The distance and bearing for Step Y is not explicitly stated in the footnote, and the Rice map is both difficult to read, and also, as already proven, cannot be correct anyway, as the line it depicts as straight cannot be straight. Instead, I have borrowed Schlieder’s measurements of the line that states the course in Step Y is S 10° 43' 36" W True, which I have rounded slightly to S 10° 44' W for this purpose. I have also used Schlieder's distances for Step Y. Shlieder's measurement of Step X is equivalent to the 320 feet stated in the footnote, and also note that it is essentially equal to the 4 chains 83 links distance explicitly stated in Steps 2 and 3 of the 1883 Mills’ Home deed description. This is why I say that the traditional interpretation of the older deeds fits the 1883 placement of Point C, which makes sense as that would be the least disruptive interpretation, not impacting the other properties that share Point C.

The difference between the two distances (X and Y) is approximately 25 feet, which is the stated distance between the "center line of the highway" and both the iron pipe set by Miller in 1972 and the "highway monument" (Deeds 499/981). And of course, as before, Step Z will be further adjusted to S 64° 30' E to properly align the road with the other surveys, and when mapped, roughly accounts for the 9.5 feet given by Miller. 


Combining the Tract III pseudo-survey with those for 1869 and 1883 seems to confirm–despite several imperfections in the fit–that Tract III appears to be an attempt to reconcile Rice's Broken Line and perhaps ultimately, the traditional interpretation of 1869 and 1883.   


How these three pseudo-surveys look overlaid on Dresser:


Now overlaying the three pseudo-surveys on Schlieder:


And finally, its fit on the western boundary of Dalebrook as drawn by Miller:


A side-by-side comparison of each: 

So, it seems that the intention of the footnote defining "Tract III" is to reconcile Rice and Miller, or perhaps more generally, to reconcile the True interpretation of 1869 and 1883 that was first introduced by Rice. However, as has been shown, the referenced Miller survey, verified by Schlieder, proves that the Rice survey was in error, so there is nothing to reconcile in that regard, and as I will show, this is not the correct way to reconcile the differences in 1869 and 1883. 

Yet, during the 1992 sale of Mills' Home, despite clear documentary evidence contrary to its central premise, a boundary line/encroachment agreement was filed based on Rice's Broken Line:

<figure>

> WHEREAS, the easterly line of said Lattin adjoins the westerly line of said Proto; and

> WHEREAS, a corner of a shed and railroad tie retaining wall erected by Lattin projects over the common property line on to the Proto property according to a survey titled "Survey Map Shkowing House Location at 475 Brooktondale Rd., Town of Caroline, Tompkins Co., New York", which survey is attached hereto and which is being recorded herewith;

Interestingly, in an updated version of the Schlieder survey included with the 1992 boundary line agreement, which still included the notes corroborating the Miller/Dalebrook survey, the iron pipes are no longer shown, even though they were clearly still present.

Dresser in 2023 found all iron pipes, including Miller's set pipe by the road, now bent, essentially confirming Miller 1970/11, but acknowledging that the lower iron pipe was itself not directly on the precise line, a result of more accurate measuring technology used.

As we already showed above, Dresser seems to essentially corroborate the True Mandeville Line, matching Points C and B, the center of the road and with the southwest corner of the dwelling as the approximate starting point. 


Dresser’s line is a variation of Miller’s Dalebrook line, which seems to corroborate the True Mandeville Line even more closely:


And likewise, Schlieder:


In other words, the original 1869 pseudo-survey fits all the maps better than the 1883 pseudo-survey. With the exception of Rice’s Broken Line, every survey matches the 1869 Mandeville Line at Points C and B; 1883 never matches up with the surveys this way, and as already show, is mathematically incompatible with 1869.

To properly reconcile 1869 and 1883, Points B and C *must* match between them. Recognizing this fact, set aside the previous approach of combining the pseudo-surveys and instead of lining up Creek Road and the center of the mill race bridge, only align Points B and C:


This suggests a different possibility for reconciling 1869 and 1883, if there is a way to get 1883 back to the center of the road, where we know he must be. I believe there is a way to do this, but it means questioning a fundamental assumption: that the maps should be interpreted as True bearings. I will now explore Magnetic interpretations of 1869 and 1883 to see what they may reveal. 


The True interpretation of 1869 and 1883, which has been the traditional interpretation of the lot’s boundaries, was first documented by Gordon Rice, in his survey on 08 Jul 1969, Deeds 482/529, the very first survey map of either Mills' Home or Dalebrook, and this influenced everyone after. Rice appears to base his assessment on the presence of the “Old Iron Pipe” (OIP) that is on a True 9 degree line collinear with Point C. A few years later, Miller will find the OIP as do both Schlieder and Dresser after him. The OIP is the kink in Rice's Broken Line, and as I write this, it bears Dresser's orange ribbon, easily visible from the "three room addition". The True, traditional, interpretation of 1869 and 1883 rests entirely on the presence of the OIP.

The OIP was most likely put in place in the 20th century. Because 1869 and 1883 are provably Magnetic, it would not have been placed there at either time. In fact, I believe there is indirect evidence that no markers were present in 1883 because if there were, an accurate reading of a single line would reveal the 1 degree difference in Magnetic declination, allowing 1883 to calibrate his measurements to accurately reflect 1869 without needing to directly know the Magnetic declination for either year. If, say, only Points B and C were marked in 1883, then 1869 could be replicated with confidence, even if every other landmark mentioned moved, 1883 would still know with a high degree of accuracy where they were located in physical space in 1869. 

Gordon Rice specifically calls the pipe “old” instead of merely acknowledging it with the more common phrase “iron pipe found”. So, I think that 1912 highway survey presents the likely first opportunity for the pipe to be placed there, despite John Mandeville’s input in that process.

As late as the Dalebrook deed of 08 Nov 1920 (198/201), the common boundary line is not explicitly described, but instead merely says "excepting therefrom the former Wolcott lot (now Mills)". The first explicit description of the boundary line only comes with the Dalebrook deed of 03 July 1934 (235/85), and is perhaps the most likely time for the mistaken placement of the OIP.

A direct measurement of the OIP is never given, and I cannot find it mentioned in any deed description for either Mills' Home or Dalebrook. Perhaps its presence, in the middle of a long line on a steep hill, was merely a convenience for measuring the line in smaller steps at a time when such measurements were more challenging. 

But this is just speculation on my part, and as far as I know, there is no direct evidence for who put the iron pipe there, or for what reason. If it was intended to indicate a True, 9 degree Mandeville Line, it was provably done in error.

To try to gain further insight, I have examined both the Mills' Home and Dalebrook surveys–the only surveys I have found to show the OIP–to see if there is a mathematical relationship between the OIP and other points or landmarks. The closest I could find is neither definitive nor apparently relevant: if a line is drawn from the OIP to the concrete highway monument on the brow of the hill, it appears to be parallel, or nearly so, to both the Highway Line and the center line of the road. An obvious implication is that a line perpendicular with the road that intersects the OIP will also be perpendicular to the line from the OIP to the hill monument, creating right angles. 


(Recall that various surveys over the years have given slightly different angles for the road when corrected for Magnetic declination.)

If we interpret “old” to simply mean “already existing” then this would fit the timing of the placement of the concrete monument on the hill brow as a result of the appropriation a few years before Rice. 

{{% fig "brookton/maps/map-819-top-map-only" "800" /%}}

However, the appropriation map above makes no reference to the OIP. I will additionally point out that there is a mis-match between the type of marker used, stone/granite vs. an iron pipe. Therefore, I conclude there is no apparent connection to these points. 

Whatever else can be said about the Mills' Home eastern boundary line, it is certain that the Mills' Home deed description that is current as I write this is incorrect. 

The documentary evidence suggests that I may be the first person to know the correct eastern boundary line of the Mills' Home lot since at least the time of Emily Mills' death. John Mandeville, or whoever the 1869 surveyor was, gave William Benton Wolcott the gift of The Mandeville Triangle, handed down to each successive owner waiting to be used again as it was in 1883. And if the 1883 surveyor had not chosen a new Place of Beginning, he would have simply replicated 1869, and he would not have taught us how to properly close Mandeville's Triangle, and we would have no support for the Magnetic interpretation. 

It is interesting to me that the area on the eastern side of Mills' Home that is encompassed by the Magnetic interpretation is the same approximate area area that I already maintained since moving in. When I purchased Mills' Home, Frank Proto offered to extend an agreement he had with Andrea Talmadge, that I could plant what I wanted in that area and maintain it as if it were part of my property, and so I have kept it mowed and tidy from the beginning of my tenure.


## Independently Measuring Point D

Point D ends at the center of Creek Road at the termination of the “brow of the hill” which is a rather inexact landmark. Unless there was a marker placed at that point in 1869, and there is no evidence for or against the existence of such a marker, then it seems the  only way to accurately locate this point is to derive it by measuring backward from the Place of Beginning using the distance given in Step 5 in 1869, and of course, that then assumes that the center of the bridge in 1869 has been accurately located. In other words, if the location of the 1869 Place of Beginning cannot be accurately determined, then the location of Point D will be off by the same amount, even if its location is self-consistent with the other points placed in 1883.

For independent corroboration of the exact location of Point D, which I hoped would in turn shed light on the Mill Race Bridge placement at different times, I consulted the historical deeds of 457 Brooktondale Road, the lot on the western side of the brow of the hill. But among the deeds for 457, the very first specific measurement to Point D of Mills' Home is not given until the first description of "Parcel 2" in 1955:

<figure>

> Beginning in the center of the Brooktondale-Ithaca Highway at a point in the south corner of premises...running thence southeasterly along the center of the highway **about 110 feet** to the northwest line of premises now owned by the E. H. Mills Estate; running thence northeast and along a wire fence along premises of the Mills Estate, Boyce property and F. C. Vorhis...

The 110 feet figure is explicitly mentioned again in Deeds 444/1002 in 1963 and in Deeds 488/695 in 1970, and is implicitly found in Deeds 527/14 in 1974 in the measurement "198.3 feet along the highway line to a monument in the northerly line of the highway".

The deed immediately prior to the first use of the "about 110 feet" measurement describes a large portion of the original Benjamin Vandemark farm that had not yet been divided, and gives no specific measurements relative to Mills' Home"

Vorhis and E. H. Mills Estate and Boice property, containing 10 acres of land, more or less.

The "south corner" is a bit ambiguous, but the subsequent description makes it clear that this refers to the pipe set by Thomas Miller in 1986 that is located in the southeast corner of 457 Parcel 1 and the southwest corner of 457 Parcel 2, as seen in the following survey:  

{{% fig "brookton/maps/637-189" "800" /%}}

The following diagram combines measurements given in the deed descriptions and survey maps of both 457 and 475, along with Points A and D that I have defined above. Following the example of the 457 survey map, measurements are not in feet and inches, but feet and fractions of feet.  

{{% fig "brookton/maps/475-brookton/point-d-diagram" "800" /%}}

Equipped with a measuring wheel, I used this diagram as a guide to try to locate Point D in physical space.

[TODO; results of attempts to measure, photo of retaining wall]

There are a number of reasons to doubt the "about 110 feet" figure. This distance was determined nearly half a century after the death of E. H. Mills, and two decades after Emily's death, so references to "premises now owned by the E. H. Mills Estate" instead of the Brewers leaves doubt to how carefully the Mills' Home lot was researched. 

Additionally, a careful reading leaves open doubt about where exactly the fence on the brow of the hill ended in relation to the road, as it is not mentioned until *after* the northwest turn. Also keep in mind that as I write this, that area has a large concrete retaining wall rising from the shoulder of the road, holding back a high hill; although this has obviously changed over the years, its hard to imagine the hill sloping gently to the road 70 years ago. So, it is unclear how accurately the fence could be used as a landmark at that time for the purposes of locating Point D. This is also a decade before the road project that displaced the Shurter House, and it wasn't until several years after *that*, that Gordon Rice created the first survey map of Mills' Home. 

But even more frustratingly, when this "about 110 feet" description was written, the Brewer deeds of the Mills' Home lot still defined Point D relative to the center of the Mill Race Bridge *as it was described in 1883*. After 1883, the Mill Race Bridge apparently shifted westward based on evidence detected by [ground penetrating racar]({{% relref "#echoes-of-the-tailrace" %}}) in 2023, and the Mill Race Bridge disappeared entirely several decades before this "about 100 feet" measurement was determined. This explains why the 110 foot distance approaches the tailrace as detected by [ground penetrating racar]({{% relref "#echoes-of-the-tailrace" %}}), but is still significantly off, seemingly impossibly so, to the west. "About 110 feet" seems to be a very rough estimate based on a distant memory of a landmark that even then, had moved many decades earlier.

Therefore, I have to conclude that this measurement is inaccurate and unfortunately, it only further obscures the location of Point D.
