A compilation of information and photographs from the late 1960's to the mid 2000's, during the years the home was owned by C. Dalton and Clara B. Jones, then Larry and Janet Lattin, and then by Andrea Talmadge. Each set of owners did much to improve the home and property that is still evident presently.

I have been in contact with the previous three sets of owners, and with each, I have offered to publish with this material any memories of their time in the home that they were willing to share with me. I left it completely open as to what to write about, how much to write, and when to get the information to me. I will add any such information I receive from them in a timely manner.

It appears that Jessie and Lewis Brewer never lived in the Mills home, but rented it until it was purchased by the Jones family. While they owned the home, the following refrigerator was presumably purchased in Ithaca:

## C. Dalton and Clara B. Jones

Jessie Brewer sold the home to Clarence Dalton Jones, known professionally as C. Dalton Jones, and his wife Clara Brown Jones on 12 Jul 1969 (Deeds 482, p528, Tompkins County Clerk, Ithaca NY.) The Jones family initially moved to the Ithaca area in 1966 to pursue graduate degrees at Cornell University.

Clarence Dalton Jones (06 Jul 1940, St. Louis MO) began his career as an industrial chemist before entering the field of education, and he was a research associate, lecturer and doctoral candidate at Cornell in 1969. C. Dalton was also active in the local community, volunteering for local organizations including Caroline Elementary School and running for the Ithaca School Board. 

<blockquote>
<p>
C. Dalton Jones, research associate and lecturer, received a bachelor's degree in psychology in 1962 at Rutgers University and a master's degree in experimental psychology from Tufts Universtiy in 1965. He is currently a doctoral candidate in child development at Cornell and has worked in education, particularly curriculum development in urban black schools.
</p>
<p>
His research and teaching interest, range from the study of competence in black children to psychological aspects of culture and political awareness in Afro Americans.

<p>
…C. Dalton Jones, a Cornell research associate in black studies and psychology who lives in Brooktondale, said Ithacans are fortunate to have a school district willing to "break with old habits" and offer alternative programs from which to choose. Study must be interesting and provide some "payoff" to students beyond the report card, he said. He suggested that parents can improve schools and save money by making furnishings and materials on such topics as local history.
</p>
<p>
When a student is disruptive "something is troubling this person," Jones said. "He's saying, 'Look at me–I’m here, I count’”. Special programs should be designed for alienated students, and rules should be made clear each fall instead of after trouble occurs.

After Cornell and Brooktondale, C. Dalton became a professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and Clara pursued postdoctoral work at Harvard University. There appears to be a few years’ transition period as the family moved out of the area for a new life, and rented the home before finally selling it to the Lattins.

## Larry and Janet Lattin
 
Lawrence E. and Janet L. Lattin purchased the home on 14 Nov 1979. 16 Aug 2022, I reached out to Larry and Janet by telephone, introducing myself for the first time and asking them about the history of the home. 

Larry mentioned that he “gutted the house” and rewired much of it. He put on the rear addition as I know it, and added the basement steps. He also added the present tool shed, and as I write this, “Lattin” (or possibly "Larry") is still just visible, etched into the floor immediately inside the entrance, while the cement was drying. It appears there might be more letters etched in this way, but at this point, it is too faded for me to distinguish from the photographs.

When the Lattin's sold the home to Andrea Talmadge in 1992, the shed foundation became the basis of a boundary encroachment agreement between the Lattins and Frank Proto that I subsequently also inherited. I believe I can provide compelling evidence to refute the basis of the alleged encroachment, which I have begun documenting in the section: {{% pagelink "mill-race-bridge-barn" %}}.

Larry also told a remarkable story. While replacing the front door, items stored in a space above the door fell out. The items included old medicine bottles, post cards, and what Larry described as “a Civil War belt”(!) along with old medicine bottles and postcards. 

The Lattins still own the belt and shared this among other photographs of it:

{{% fig "mills-home/civil-war-belt/2023-08-11-2" "800" /%}}

More photographs of the belt as well as an exploration of its possible owners can be found in {{% pagelink "property-features#the-civil-war-belt" "this section" %}}

The Lattins gave the bottles to a collector and donated the post cards to the Caroline History Room. I consulted with Barbara Kone, and she said that if local people are identified in the postcards, they would be put in the respective family folders, but after a few hours of effort, I could not find any postcards in the History Room that are connected with any previous owner of the home.

<blockquote>
<p>
When I bought the house, the Lattins had added a one room shack lean-to off the kitchen.  Janet Lattin ran a day-care and she had her husband install an all-glass wall so the kids could be out in the playroom and she could keep an eye on them.
</p>
<p>
When the main roof was replaced early on, I was told that the lean-to was causing damage to the house and should be torn down - (post tear-down photo attached).  At that point, we decided to build a legit addition to the house and the sliding doors were moved to the patio side as exit doors.  The solid panel of glass stayed.
</p>
<p>
I'm fairly certain that Larry Lattin rewired the entire house - but I could be wrong.

## Andrea Talmadge

Andrea Talmadge purchased the home from the Lattins on 27 Aug 1992. This day was also the first day of instruction of the Fall semester at Cornell University, where Adam Smith was starting his junior year. (Cornell University Courses of Study Vol. 83 1991/92, ecommons.cornell.edu.)

</div>

Even from my initial inspection of the home during the sale, it was very evident the effort Andrea and her partner John Callaghan had put into the home, as many aspects of the home and property had been upgraded in some way, and much of it by their own hands. A key point in our negotiations happened when I reached out to Andrea directly, much to the chagrin of our real estate agents: I told her that I understood she had a deep emotional connection with the home, and I assured her that I would do my best to preserve her work and maintain her high standards. Andrea loved the home and the community very much and even years later, misses both greatly.

Over the years, I have reached out to Andrea several times with questions about the home, and she was always very willing to help. As part of these exchanges, I would also tell her about recent improvements I had made to the home, and generally share with her the state of the home and the neighborhood.

<figure>
<blockquote>
<p>
Originally, the house was square more or less.
</p>
<p>
What is currently the dining room (or was for us) - was the kitchen.  The sink seemed to have been in a couple of places:  on the bathroom side of the room and the window side (we found holes in the floor when we tore up the carpeting)
</p>
<p>
The kitchen wall ended where the ceiling slope begins. 
</p>
<p>
The chimney end of the living room - was the dining room.  The dining and living room were divided by a wall - and there were French doors between them.  In the dining room - against that wall were built-in cabinets.  We left the brass latch piece when we renovated the living room.
</p>
<p>
At any rate, the back wall of the original house was demolished by the Lattins (I think they have moved back to Brooktondale - they know more about the changes they made to add the huge kitchen and master bedroom) and a back window space was left (over the kitchen sink) and the light switch used to control the light at the former back of the house.

Referring to the basement, starting with the time immediately after Andrea purchased the home: 

<figure>
<blockquote>

> To be on the safe side, all of the stuff we put in the basement went on pallets.  The 1st spring, we learned about hillside drainage.  Bought a surface pump which worked well as needed.
>
> There was a functioning drain in the floor - it went under the road...through the Andersson's field most likely, and into the creek.   When the creek was flooded, it wouldn't drain...we feared the creek would end up in the basement.
>
> When Brooktondale road was rebuilt (it was really in seriously bad shape from the constant parade of gravel trucks), that pipe seems to have been crushed in the process - and stopped working.
>
> When you put in the perimeter drainage, did you find the previous perforated pipes in the back and driveway side of the house?
>
> We replaced some of the duct work when we renovated the downstairs floors - I think the one near the front door was the most critical as we had to move the opening when we repaired the floor at the front door.  Also, under the dining room window.

As I write this, this drain is still present in the floor of the basement near the front wall of the house on the eastern side. 

<div class="cols">
{{% fig "adams-photos/foundation/2024-02-05 14.57.14" "350" /%}}

I too had an experience my first Spring that taught me about hillside drainage. I have progressively built a more robust infrastructure for keeping the basement dry. For example, in the first photograph above, you can see a seam in the concrete a few inches from the wall, resulting from Halco installing a Waterguard perimeter drainage pipe in 2019. The lip of the piping can be seen where the concrete meets the stone. I wasn't on site for this work, so I don't know if the Halco crew found the previous perforated pipes.

In consultation with stone mason Terry Jones on 10 Jan 2024, he confirmed what I had thought: the concrete floor of the basement was likely poured over the existing dirt floor in the decades following Emily Mills' death. He noted that its smoothness indicated that it was done in one pour from a cement truck, vs. hand mixed cement done in sections and manually graded. The drain was likely installed at that time.

On my first day entering the home as her new owner, on the kitchen counter were a number of items left by Andrea and John, including well organized appliance manuals, a list of home improvements they made during their time as owners (a practice I continued), a list of the neighbors, their addresses and phone numbers, and brief descriptions of them, and finally, the photographs that follow further below.

In the note on neighbors, John wrote that Jim Todi was a “manure afficianado”, although it would take me some years to appreciate what a high compliment this was. He also said of Chad Novelli that he “can fix just about anything”.

The following is a summary of the larger projects Andrea and John tackled:

| | | | 
| ---- | ------ | --------- | 
| 1993 | 3 Room Addition | Addition added to kitchen, replacing previous lean-to structure |
| 1994 | Attic | 4 roof vents installed; Pull-down attic stairs installed |

| 2005 | Dining Room | Driveway side of roof replaced | 
| 2006 | Dining Room | New cedar plank floor installed and finished |

I believe the following photos show the house as it was when the Lattins lived in it. Beginning with the downstairs.

The brass latch for the french door, which as Andrea mentioned above, is still in the hardwood floors, as well as the floor patches in the footprint of the wall, indicate the doors were on the stairs-side of the wall. In 2022:

When I arrived the stove was no longer there, and the chimney had been closed. An unpatched hole in the back wall where the stove pipe entered the chimney was still there, covered by a plastic sheet and a large, heavy mirror. The mirror is still there covering the hole , and I have an electric “fireplace” on the wall below it. In 2021, when the roofing was replaced, the top of the chimney was taken down to the roof line and capped.

The dining room. The hanging light was still there for a decade after I owned the home. During the Covid-19 pandemic, I decided to move my home office from the larger front bedroom upstairs to the dining room, replacing the overhead light as part of the remodeling process.

The downstairs half bathroom next to the stairs. The carpet shown on the stairs was not there when I arrived, but the large space left at the bottom of the trim in the upstairs hallway remains as evidence of this high pile carpet.

The large front bedroom was for the first decade I owned it, my home office, where much of the work for the Finger Lakes Beer Trail was done. This paint and wallpaper were still there when I purchased the home, and I repainted the walls after a few years. The ceiling had glow-in-the-dark stars and glow-in-the-dark paint on it, which clearly meant something to someone in the past, so I haven't had the heart to paint over it. When asked about this, Andrea's response was: "The fluorescent stars and paint - were done by my older daughter, Heather (w/out permission, of course)." (07 Jan 2020, personal correspondence.)

</div>

In the middle bedroom, the carpet, closet doors and overhead light all remained when I arrived. Initially, this ceiling was also painted blue with white clouds and more glow-in-the-dark stars. I eventually repainted this room also. After my last cat died, I ripped up the shag carpet, which along with the underlayment was very tattered and worn, and had clearly been there for a very long time. The carpet covered a heat vent that is apparently disconnected from the rest of the ductwork, and the hardwood floor beneath needed some work to fully restore, as several patches had been made with 2x4 unstained pine lumber, and wall paint used in the past had dripped onto and smeared the floorboards. Instead of trying to restore the original hardwood floor, I left it in place, and I personally installed new hardwood bamboo flooring over top of it.

Based on the for-sale sign, the following appears to be from 1992, when the Lattins were still occupying. Notice the clothesline beyond the shed, and the children’s play area behind the real estate sign.

The pine tree partially shown on the left edge of the photograph was still there when I purchased the home, and taken down by NYSEG on 28 Mar 2013, as it was interfering with overhead wires. The photo below was taken through the window of the small bedroom. 

{{% fig "adams-photos/2013-03-28_11.11.19" "500" "img,link" /%}}

In the photo below, the foremost tree along Brooktondale Road was also removed by NYSEG for interfering with the overhead wires. A utility pole is immediately beyond it, and then a large tree just over the property line on Dalebrook was also removed, both done in the early 2010’s. The Lockwood home, Mills’ store and Dalebrook are all partially visible in the background.

When I arrived, the hillside was beautifully landscaped with a number of stone paths around garden beds and leading to a simple platform constructed of treated lumber that sat above the garden and a few feet higher than the upper roof line. I enjoyed sitting up on that platform, and I recall Mary Andersson remarking how she enjoyed looking out at the hillside from her home. Unfortunately, this was an area that was beyond my ability to successfully maintain. The structure of the steps relied upon untreated logs from the hill that eventually rotted away, allowing the soil erosion on the steep hill to take over. At one point in the early-mid 2010’s, a dead tree on the hill fell across the wooden platform and flower garden, severely damaging the platform and crushing a few rows of the stone steps.

The wooden platform can be seen in the photographs below, its front edge built against a tree to keep it from sliding down the hill.

Unfortunately, the magnolia tree had to be removed as it became too big and was too close to the front porch.

The home, very close to how it appeared when I first moved into it.
