Jonas Edward Mills, born 18 Feb 1852, Staten Island NY, died 13/14 October 1885, Brookton NY. Oldest child of Edward Hallock and Mary Ann Mills. Jonas worked as clerk in E. H. Mills' dry goods store in Mott's Corners/Brookton and he was a member of the High Bridge Lodge #296 of the Independent Order of Good Templars, a temperance group in Brookton.

Jonas was a member of the Brookton ["High Bridge Lodge #296"]({{% relref "temperance" %}})  of the Independent Order of Good Templars, for at least part of the time that Emily was also a member.

Jonas' death came several months after Reverend Horace N. Humiston sold the Mills' Home to Esther Vorhis. (Caroline Deeds 5, p138.) Although I can't say for certain that the Mills lived in the home at 475 Brooktondale Road the entire time they lived in Brooktondale–as I am still researching deeds in light of the 1880 Federal Census–I am reasonably confident that Jonas died in the home that was [“occupied by E. H. Mills as tenant”]({{% relref "other-past-owners" %}}) by 1891 (Deeds 138, p329).

The 1885 New York State Death Index lists Jonas as dying on October 14:

However, the Ithaca Daily Journal reported that he died on Tuesday, which in 1885 fell on the 13th. Both the Ithaca Daily Journal and The Daily News in Batavia agree that he was interred on Thursday 15 Oct 1885:

On Monday, 12 Oct 1885, as Jonas lay ill, the Ithaca Daily Journal (p3, q13) reported the area was experiencing "Indian Summer" accompanied by "gorgeous sunsets" that for the Mills family cast in silhouette the great wooden trestle in Brookton. On Wednesday, 14 October, the barometer fell, predicting rain and colder temperatures for the following day, when Jonas was interred alongside his brother [Horace]({{% relref "mills-horace-f-1854" %}}) at Corfu. By Friday, the sky cleared and warmer temperatures returned in time for the planned Good Templars’ “pie and fruit party” at Lounsbery Hall, above [E. H. Mills’ general store]({{% relref "me-mills" %}}) in Brookton, where Jonas had been working as clerk not a week prior. (13 Oct 1885, Ithaca Daily Journal, Ithaca NY, p3, q31, nyshistoricnewspapers.org.)

I have not yet found follow-up reporting on the Good Templars' party, and considering that the announcement in the Journal was printed before Jonas' death, perhaps the party above the Mills family store was subsequently cancelled. An examination of the Good Templars' Meeting Minutes presently archived at the Tompkins County History Center will show that there are meeting minutes for the Friday evening prior, 09 Oct, and the following Friday evening, 23 Oct, but no meeting was recorded for Friday, 16 Oct.

I assume that Edward, Mary Ann and Emily all accompanied Jonas to Corfu, in a trip similar to that described for [Mary Ann]({{% relref "mills-mary-ann-1819" %}}) a decade later. Jonas died during the time that Edward was Brookton Postmaster, and George Richardson was working for Edward.

Jonas is [interred](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/75958930/jonas-e-mills) at Evergreen Hill Cemetery, 112 Alleghany Rd, Corfu NY 14036.
