This section introduces the family of William Mills, a first cousin of Edward Mills' father Jonas Davis Mills, who lived in western NY during a time that overlaps with the time Edward Mills' family was living in Corfu NY, likely less than 20 miles away.

Portraits of William Mills' family were digitally scanned by Queens Public Library archives Jun 2022 from print photographs in their collection: The Mills Family of Jamaica and Mills Pond, Long Island, Archives at Queens Library, Queens Borough Public Library. The backs of the photographs were also scanned and are shown beside the fronts. The following is my attempt to identify the subjects of these photos and provide historical context for their lives. 

First a note on the process I used to make my determinations, which involves a few simple assumptions as well as judging probabilities and a process of elimination in addition to the direct physical evidence of the photographs.

To begin, I regard as proof of identify either direct identification on the photographic media itself, or a clear match to a different identified portrait of the people in question, which fortunately, are both satisfied for James D. Warren and his son Orsamus George Warren. The identifications of the portraits with California imprints are compelling based on their unique overlap with the known family history of Daniel and Martha Helme Baker. 

I am also considering the portraits as at least a loosely related set, which is shakier ground given that we don't know exactly how they came to be preserved originally. A Mills or Warren descendant may have donated Mills family photographs along with those of other ancestors that are not related to the Mills or Warrens. The more recent history of the portraits is clearer, however, as they were in a Mills family collection at the Buffalo History Museum along with other items related to William and Deborah Mills and their son James Harrison Mills, before being transferred to Queens Public Library. I will also make a case for separately identifying Deborah and William in the portraits of the two older individuals, despite no direct evidence on the photographic media themselves for viewing them as a couple.

Therefore, based on the portraits that can be identified, and what is known of the related families in western New York at the time, that the remaining portraits are more likely than not other Mills or Warren family members, and if that is true, it suggests that the likelihood of identifying them increases the closer we are to the subjects of the portraits that can be identified. With this in mind, I will focus on first degree relatives of James D. Warren and his two wives, Laura Love and Mary Mills, including in-laws married to those first degree relatives. Within this set of candidates, the vast majority can be eliminated for various reason that will be shown, and that, along with the direct evidence provided by the photographs themselves, will point to the most likely identities.  

These portraits are typical examples of *Cartes de Visite* or visiting cards, also called "card portraits" among several other similar and commonly used names,  and in the 20th century they began being referred to by the acronym CDV. CDVs were typically 2.5"x4", and judging the sizes of these particular Mills family portraits based on the scanned image metadata, the average size is 2.4"x3.97". 

CDVs replaced earlier tintypes and daguerreotypes, formats which resulted in unique photographs that could only be copied by photographing the original photograph. CDVs were produced by exposing photographic paper to a glass negative and then mounting the thin paper on a stiff card, and as a result, it was possible to create multiple copies of a single photograph for the first time. The paper medium of CDV's was also much less expensive than the previous media, was easier for the customer to handle, and CDVs created higher quality images and looked more elegant as well, and due to technological advances of the time, exposures could be completed in as little as one second or less in bright light. All of these factors, along with the American Civil War, which caused widespread separation of families, created a sudden increase in demand for photography. CDVs were introduced to America in 1860 and were at peak popularity from 1863 to 1878, gradually displaced by the larger cabinet card format to the point that CDVs had virtually disappeared by 1890.

During this period, a combination of changing photographic standards, styles of mounting cards, as well as changing styles of hair and clothing provide a powerful basis for dating CDVs. What follows are my attempts to identify and date the photographs, primarily relying on the volume *19th Century Card Photos KwikGuide*, Gary W. Clark, 2013, phototree.com (hereafter: KG). I will provide evidence that most, and perhaps all of the photos are from the early to mid 1860’s.  

As each CDV is examined, keep the following features and their implications in mind:

  - **Borders:** “Nearly all pre-1863 cards have no border. Even though borders first appeared in 1862 (usually hand drawn) this style was not widely used until 1864. … The first commonly used borders usually consisted of two thin gilt lines of the same width. These have only been found on documented 1863 and 1864 cards. Beginning in 1864, nearly all documented cards, especially the vast number with tax stamps, have two gilt lines, but the outer line is considerably thicker that the inner line. This dual-width style of border remained almost unchanged until about 1869.” (KG, p18.) *The QPL portraits show examples of no border, single, and same-width double borders.*

  - **Card Corners:** “Early carte de visits had square cut corners. … Around 1870, along with the introduction of the thicker cards, the cards now had rounded corners.” (KG, p20.)

  - **Photographer’s Imprint:** “The first imprints were very simple, one to three lines of text identifying the photographer or studio, and the address, most stamped by the photographer themselves. But when the mass produced, pre-cut cards from major manufacturers became available after 1863, the imprints gradually became more elaborate especially patriotic imprints…were very popular during the Civil War years.” (KG: p21.) 

  - **Head Poses:** “The head post was most popular in the early 1860’s, usually treated with a vignette look, with the area around the head feathered or gradually fading away. The image area in these head poses was quite small, due to camera and lens technology at that time. The camera was usually 12 or more feet from the subject, and the concept of telephoto or zoom did not exist.” (KG, p22.) *Most of the QPL portraits are head vignettes.*

  - **Seated Poses:** “Full seated poses were still frequently taken into the early 1870s. However, these poses tended to give way to close up portraits and mostly vanished by the mid 1870s. One exception was children.” (KG, p22.)

  - **Standing Poses:** “Full length photos of people standing were very popular beginning in the early 1860’s, faded later in the decade, and became rare by the mid 1870s.” (KG, p22.) *These QPL portraits contain two standing photos, both of which have a same-width double border.*

  - **Women’s Hairstyles:** “Cartes de visite from the early 1860’s show many examples of pulled-back hair being the standard for women, though it was less taut than previous decades.” (KG, p25.) *Among the QPL portraits, all three women photographed had this hairstyle.*  

To begin, two of the photographs are explicitly identified. The first is "James D. Warren":

James is explored in more detail further below.

The second photograph identifies "Orsamus George Warren":

Orsamus' identification is corroborated by a later photograph:

</div>

Orsamus George Warren's photo, apparently taken in New York when he was a very young man, may coincide with his tour of Europe at the age of 17, notably accompanied by his father's business partner and eventual rival James N. Matthews. The following are two accounts of that trip, and there are others corroborating it: 

<figure>
<blockquote>
He then attended the college at Canandaigua, but his health failing he was sent abroad in the summer of his 17th year. He remained on the continent for 18 months, and studied French classics for six months at the University of Paris, where he creditably acquitted himself.

<blockquote>
About the year 1868 the young man took about a year’s vacation and spent the time traveling in Europe with a party of which James N. Matthews was one. A year or so after his return he took an extended Western trip with John Bullymore and others, visiting numerous points in the Rocky Mountain and Sierra Nevada region. The trip lasted several months.

The fact that only two photos in the collection  are identified may or may not be meaningful, and even if meaningful, open to interpretation. However, given the circumstantial evidence that includes these being specifically in a Mills family collection, that they are both Warren's, and that judging by the handwriting and (ball point) ink, these appear to have been written by the same person at the same time, I believe a valid theory is that the person who wrote these names thought that these portraits were more likely to be forgotten by future descendants, implying that the remaining photos are Mills.

{{% fig "mills-family/buffalo/portrait-comparisons/handwriting" "800" /%}}

There are also several known portraits of James D. Warren's only other son with second wife Mary (Mills) Warren, William Candee Warren, proving that he is not among the unidentified photos:

The clearest evidence for dating the remaining portraits comes from the inclusion of Civil War tax stamps on several, such as appears on James D. Warren's photograph above, and on an older woman's photograph:

<blockquote>
...the first revenue stamps printed by the United States government were issued in the midst of the American Civil War, prompted by the urgent need to raise revenue to pay for the great costs it incurred. ... Among the more notable instances of tax stamp usage occurred in the photography trade. As the Civil War progressed, the demand for photographs of family members, soldiers going off to war and returning war heroes increased dramatically, but not without the notice from the Federal government who saw the advent as an opportunity to raise much needed revenue for the war. On August 1, 1864 the Internal Revenue department passed a 'photograph tax' requiring photographers to pay a tax on the sale of their photographs. By 1864 there were no 'photography tax' stamps issued, so other stamps were substituted, typically, the proprietary or playing card revenue stamps was used, usually affixed to the back of the photograph. Already burdened with high overhead costs and scarcity of materials because of the war, large photograph companies organized and petitioned Congress, complaining that they were shouldering too much of the tax burden placed on the public. After exactly two years their constant efforts resulted in the tax being repealed on August 1, 1866. Several other widely used products, such as cotton, tobacco and alcohol, were also charged a proprietary tax which appreciably contributed to the revenues generated.

> The tax was based on the selling price of the image. 2-cent tax for pictures costing less than 25 cents. ...All stamps included a description designating what the stamp was originally intended for, though no photograph-specific stamps were produced, many different stamps were used. Such designations include "Bank Check", "Proprietary", "Express", and other names; and stamps were produced in a variety of colors. (KG, p23.)


Notice that on each of the above photos with an accompanying stamp, the "Proprietary" stamp is cancelled with matching name and handwriting, and the year "1866" is clearly written on each:

{{% fig "mills-family/buffalo/compare-stamps" "800" /%}}

> The photographer selling the taxed images was supposed to cancel the stamp with his initials and the date. Although this can be a benefit to today's researcher, investigation has shown that less than 25% of stamps have a date recorded on them. Cancellations may include an "X", initials, a name, or some illegible scribble. (KG, p23.)

A third portrait in the collection that is explored further below is an example of a "Bank Check" stamp crossed out with a large asterisk.

On the stamps shown above, the photographer's name and initials appear to confirm that the photographer for each is G. A. Douglass (and explicit in the faded imprint on the back of James D. Warren's portrait), who, along with the other Buffalo photographers indicated in the scanned portraits, is listed in Thomas' Buffalo City Directory in 1866:

</div>

Note that the older woman in the photograph above cannot be of James D. Warren's mother [Nancy (Joslyn) Warren](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/180634896/nancy-warren) (20 Oct 1800 to 08 Jul 1843), as she died years before the existence of CDVs. Therefore, limiting consideration to family members in the appropriate generation, the most logical candidates for the identity of this older woman are either James' father's second wife [Harriet (Tiffany) Warren](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/180634971/harriet-warren) (1802 to 27 Sept 1875) or James’ wife Mary (Mills) Warren’s mother [Deborah (Smith) Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/78770568/deborah-mills) (02 Dec 1798, Smithtown NY to 13 Jun 1882, Clarence NY). Another possibility could be the wife of George Love, who I currently don't know anything about.

I have not found a photograph of Harriet to compare, but there is a photograph of her brother Silas.

{{% fig "mills-family/buffalo/portrait-comparisons/silas-durkee-tiffany-face" "350" /%}}
</div>

Further below, I will make a case for this woman being the mother of one of the young women. If that relationship is correct, then this would strongly indicate that this is Deborah Mills. Although I currently don't know the name or vital dates of George Love's wife, Laura Love's mother, and although George Love had several daughters whose vital dates are also currently unknown to me (listed below in his brief biography), Laura Love cannot be in the portraits as she died years before the existence of CDVs, and it seems unlikely on its face that this collection would contain portraits of James D. Warren's mother-in-law and sister-in-law compared to the likelihood of it being Deborah Mills and one of her daughters.

The older man is likely Deborah’s husband [William Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/78770560/william-mills) (17 Nov 1792, Smithtown NY to 15 Aug 1867, Buffalo NY), but it could also be James D. Warren’s father [Orsamus Warren](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/180634786/orsamus-warren) (07 Jun 1800 to 16 Feb 1876), although I offer the following subjective opinons: the man’s apparent age seems closer to William’s at the time the photograph was likely taken, and further, I see no resemblance between James D. Warren (or James' brother Horatio, shown further below) and this gentleman. Another possibility is George Love, who died in 1870 and so overlaps the likely timeframe of the CDVs. Again, I know very little about George Love, including his exact birthdate, although it was likely near the turn of the 19th century. These three men alone exhaust the most likely candidates from that generation.

</div>

William Mills' life will be explored in more detail below.

For comparison, William's mother [Martha (Helme) Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/68721187/martha-mills) (19 Feb 1761 to 23 Nov 1854) was painted by Shepard Alonzo Mount, {{% pagelink "mount-william-sidney" "William Sidney Mount's" %}} brother:

{{% fig "portraits/martha-helme-mills" "500" /%}}

Taking into account that one is a painting, I still believe there are similarities in the shapes of the eyes, nose and mouth. Notice in particular, how the corners of the mouths are downturned, which can also be seen in at least one of the portraits of the young women in the collection.

<div class="cols">

{{% fig "portraits/martha-helme-mills-cropped" "350" /%}}
</div>

I have not found a matching portrait for Martha's husband, [William Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/68721245/william-mills) (27 Aug 1857 to 12 June 1837) of Mills Pond, but note that Martha's portrait was purportedly painted the same year he died.

Portraits of two younger women are included, and affixed to one is a tax stamp cancelled with an asterisk, fixing the date the print was sold to between August 1864 and August 1866. Remember that CDVs simply did not exist in America prior to 1860, which rules out James D. Warren's first wife, Laura (Love) Warren, Orsamus George Warren's mother, who died in 1850.

> The large sweeping hoop dress still held fashion as the Civil War approached in the early 1860’s. But it started losing its bulk in the middle of the decade, and mostly disappeared by 1870. (KG, p27.)

> A balustrade, similar to a porch or balcony banister was a common sight in the early 1860s. …The balustrade was a holdover from the paintings of the old masters, it provided some scale to the scene in addition to depth and perspective as it was usually placed at an angle to the front plane of the photographer. The balustrade, or similar object, also provided the subject with a means to steady themselves and it was a casual resting place for a hand or arm. (KG, p62.)

> One of the early additions to the studio setting was a simple drape or even a lengthy piece of curtain material hung or placed in the background. (KG, p63.)

The photographer’s imprint indicating California is obviously a large clue to the woman’s identity, and a man’s portrait in the collection also has a California imprint, presumably pairing the two:

> By the spring of 1860, dozens of photographers in New York, Boston and Philadelphia were offering CDVs to their customers. Since an extensive network of photographers was already in place offering tintypes, ambrotypes, and even some daguerreotypes, the new CDV style spread easily. Not wanting to lose any market share, manufacturers of photographic equipment and accessories quickly embraced the new format. (KG, p15-16.) 

> The CDV ushered in several social innovations. Due to the ease in which CDVs could be produced in quantity, they were economical to exchange with other people, such as sending them to relatives or friends across the country. (KG: p11.)

The man is presumed to be [Daniel J. Baker](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/29498729/daniel-j-baker) (02 May 1827 to 25 Feb 1861), who was married to [Martha Helme (Mills) Baker](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/76889267/martha-helme-baker) (19 Jul 1833 to 01 May 1904), sister of Mary (Mills) Warren, and therefore Martha is presumed to be the woman in the other California print. If this is Daniel Baker, then the photograph was taken sometime in 1860 when CDVs were introduced to America, or very early in 1861, when he died. Furthermore, if Martha is the correct identity of the California woman, then this would seem to indicate that she stayed in California for at least a few years following his death, based on the imprint and timeframe indicated by the tax stamp.

<p>
<strong>Gold Districts of California</strong><br/> 
<strong>FOREST HILL</strong>
</p> 

<p><em>Location.</em>  The Forest Hill district is in south-central Placer County in the general vicinity of the town of that name. This district is fairlv large in area and includes not only the "diggings" 'at Forest Hill but those at Bath to the east, Todd Valley and Dardanelles to the southwest, and Yankee Jims to the northwest. The district is principally a placer-mining one, although there have been some productive quartz mines. </p>

<p><em>History.</em> Gold was discovered here in 1850. By 1852 the area was highly productive. In that year the Jenny Lind mine was discovered, and hydraulic mining was introduced at Yankee Jims by Colonel McClure. The town was an important trading center in those days. By 1868 the mines in the vicinity of the town had yielded more than $10 million. Large-scale hydraulic mining continued until the early 1880s and drift mining until the early 1900s. There was appreciable activity in the district again in the 1930s and early 1940s, and a few mines, such as the Paragon and Three Queens, have been worked since. Forest Hill is now an important lumbering center. The total output of the district is estimated to be at least $25 million, and it may be considerably more. </p>

<p><em>Geology.</em> The main early Tertiary channel of the Middle Fork of the American River enters the district from Michigan Bluff on the east. At Bath it turns north and then west and southwest and continues southwest through Forest Hill. At the Dardanelles mine west of Forest Hill, the channel swings northwest to Yankee Jims and then north to the Iowa Hill district. An intervolcanic channel extends west-southwest from Baker Ranch to north of Forest Hill. Another intervolcanic channel extends south-southwest between the above and Yankee Jims. The older quartzitic gravels near bedrock are coarse and well cemented and have yielded the most gold. Much of the gravel is overlain by rhyolite and andesite. Bedrock is slate with some phyllite, schist, and serpentine. Some of the gold-quartz veins were rich, especially those that occur near serpentine. The veins are usually three to four feet thick and strike in a northwesterly direction. A number of small but rich pockets were found in the Three Queens mine, the principal lode mine in the district. </p>

<p><em>Mines.</em> Placer: Baker Divide; Baltimore; Big Spring $150,000; Dardanelles $2 million+; Excelsior; Florida; Georgia Hill, Yankee Jim and Smiths Point, together $5 million; Grey Eagle; Homestake; Independent, New Jersey and Jenny Lind, together $2,653,000; Mayflower $1 million; Maus; Paragon $2.65 million+; Peckham Hill and Todd Valley, together $5 million; Pond; San Francisco- Small Hope; Yankee Jims. Lode: Dry Hill, Eureka, Cons. International, Mitchell, Three Queens $100,000+. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unlike hardrock mining, which extracts veins of precious minerals from solid rock, placer mining is the practice of separating heavily eroded minerals like gold from sand or gravel. The word placer is thought to have come from Catalan and Spanish, meaning a shoal or sand bar. The word entered the American vocabulary during the 1848 California Gold Rush, and when gold was discovered in Alaska and the Canadian Klondike in the late 1890s, the gold-seekers who rushed northward brought with them various placer mining technologies. By far the simplest was the prospector’s pan that worked by swirling a combination of water and gravel or sand and allowing the lighter, rocky material to spill out. Relying on the fact that gold is heavier than sand and rock is the principle used in all placer mining operations. </p>

<p> The first challenge is to find a creek drainage that over the eons has carried gold dust, flakes, and nuggets downward to be deposited in layers of creek sediments. To do this, prospectors used pans to test the surface gravels or dug straight down to a point just above bedrock where placer gold tends to collect. They then tunneled horizontally to follow the richest ground. This approach is called drift mining (the horizontal tunnel is the drift). These shafts and tunnels were typically dug in winter so that frozen ground would not melt and collapse on the miners. Even so, the practice was arduous and dangerous. In the spring and summer, a defrosting pile of gold-rich gravel called paydirt could be processed using the placer miner’s friend: water. </p>

I believe the other young woman photographed in the collection is also a daughter of William and Deborah Mills.

Consider the following comparison to the presumed portrait of Deborah Mills, who is posed very nearly identically, as I will demonstrate. I began by cropping and resizing the portraits until the pupils (as best I could judge) were aligned both vertically and horizontally at the same scale, then I drew additional parallel lines to see what other features might also align, or not.

{{% fig "mills-family/buffalo/portrait-comparisons/deborah-mary-mills-lines" "500" "img" /%}}

Although the portrait of Martha Helme (Mills) Baker is quite grainy, I believe I see points of similarity between the two.

The shape of the nose and mouth, frowning at the edges, the shape of the upper eyelids, and the pronounced cheek bones all show similarities in my eyes.

And if we agree that the young woman above is a daughter of the older woman, because the older woman cannot be James D. Warren’s mother, as she died many years before the use of this photographic process/format, then it follows, this cannot be a photo of any of James D. Warren’s sisters, who are all daughters of Nancy. In fact, all of Orasamus Warren’s Senior’s children are with his first wife [Nancy (Joslyn) Warren](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/180634896/nancy_warren) (20 Oct 1800 to 08 Jul 1843), and her death appears to be related to childbirth, as she died a month after the death of her youngest daughter [Lucia Warren](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/180635089/lucia_warren) (10 May 1843 to 05 Jun 1843), who died only a few weeks old. Therefore, in this scenario, where the younger woman is the older woman’s daughter, the identity of the older woman cannot be Harriet Tiffany, who has no children of her own that I can find. And if we further accept the older woman is mostly likely Deborah Mills, then we do not need to consider that this is a photo of James D. Warren’s in-laws:

  - [Mary M. (Everhart) Warren](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/59608825/mary-m-warren) (Oct 1843 to 12 May 1911), married to James’ brother [Horatio Nelson Warren](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/59608784/horatio-nelson-warren) (26 Oct 1838 to 22 Aug 1916), shown in photos below.
  
  - [Henrietta Sperry (Hinsdale) Warren](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/113066652/henrietta-sperry-warren) (03 Dec 1839 to 15 Mar 1924), married to James’ brother [Seth William Warren](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/113066557/seth-w-warren) (15 Mar 1841 to 19 May 1918).

And as the evidence indicates that the two younger women’s photos were taken in the early to mid 1860’s, the woman pictured cannot be the daughters of James D. and Mary (Mills) Warren, as Kate was a small child during that time frame, and Mary Hellen was not born until 1868:

  - [Kate (Warren) Bromley](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/9366865/kate-bromley) (17 Oct 1861 to 19 Jan 1945). 

  - [Mary Hellen (Warren) Vought](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/113109793/mary-helen-vought) (18 Nov 1868 to 23 Mar 1959)

Assuming this is a daughter of William and Deborah Mills, the following daughters cannot be the subject of the photograph as they each died as children before the existence of CDVs:

  - [Hannah Woodhull Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/78770518/hannah-woodhull-mills) (06 Mar 1825 to 17 Oct 1836).
  
  - [Charlotte Emma Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/78770551/charlotte-emma-mills) (07 Feb 1844 to 19 Jul 1850).

  - [Sarah Louisa Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/78770540/sarah-louisa-mills) (13 Feb 1840 to 11 Sep 1840).

This leaves only two remaining daughters not yet accounted for who could be candidates for the subject of this photo, listed with their ages in 1865, the approximate timeframe the photograph was taken: 

  - [Margaret Augusta Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/78770687/margaret-augusta-mills) (28 Nov 1822 to 02 Jun 1892), who was 43 in 1865.
  
  - [Mary Smith (Mills) Warren](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/113110177/mary-smith-warren) (19 Jun 1831 to 06 Apr 1894) who was 34 in 1865.

This is a significant difference in ages, and in my subjective judgement, the younger woman appears more likely to be in her mid-30's than her early/mid-40's.
 
The older man could still be George Love and one of his other daughters, because the young woman cannot be Laura Love, consider the relative unlikelihood of retaining a photo of James D. Warren's former father-in-law and a former sister-in-law. 

Based on this process of elimination along with the circumstantial evidence, I believe [Mary Smith (Mills) Warren](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/113110177/mary-smith-warren) (19 Jun 1831 to 06 Apr 1894), second wife of James D. Warren, is most likely the young woman photographed in Buffalo. I would also argue that the likelihood of the proposed identifications of Mary Mills and her parents reinforce each other.

<blockquote>
My knowledge of the Mills family history has always been a bit sketchy, and as far as I know there are no photos of them among my family’s possessions - except possibly a tintype portrait that belongs to my 99 year old aunt. Neither she, nor I, can identify the middle-aged, female sitter who might be Mary (Mills) Warren.

The identities of the remaining two men are most likely either brothers of either James or Mary Warren, or married to sisters of either James or Mary Warren. Siblings from both sides of the family lived in or near Buffalo (Clarence) throughout this period.

> The early 1860s still showcased the popular pompadour, heavy sideburns or mutton chops, and beards from the 1850s. However, wearing of these soon declined. As the decade progressed, the hair styles became shorter and not as high, and the facial hair was shorter and cropped much neater. The Abraham Lincoln-looking beard, full facial except for shaved upper lip can still be frequently seen. (KG, p29.)

Notice that this is the same studio and border style as the presumed photograph of William Mills above. 

> Lengthy frock coats prominently appear in early 1860s photographs, especially on older gentlemen. The end of the Civil War created an environment for change, clothing and style changes were swift. Less formal and shorter sack coats became popular throughout the decade. A casual look was brought to the photograph. (KG, p31.) 

Note that there are known photos of James D. Warren's brother Horatio, ruling him out:

Colonel Horatio Warren of the 142d Pennsylvania Volunteers edited and compiled the book [*Rally Round the Flag Boys*](https://archive.org/details/03807178.3292.emory.edu/page/n11/mode/2up) that is more commonly cited by its descriptive subtitle: "The Declaration of Independence and war history, Bull Run to Appomattox: war songs, recitations, poems, familiar songs, Decoration Day poems and speeches, concluding with a war drama, in four acts, entitled 'Tilmon Joy, The Emancipator'". The four act play was written by the Colonel himself, although I have not found evidence of it being performed.

<blockquote>
<p>The "Battle Cry of Freedom", also known as "Rally 'Round the Flag", is a song written in 1862 by American composer George Frederick Root (1820–1895) during the American Civil War. A patriotic song advocating the causes of Unionism and abolitionism, it became so popular that composer H. L. Schreiner and lyricist W. H. Barnes adapted it for the Confederacy.
<p>
</p>
A modified Union version was used as the campaign song for the Lincoln-Johnson ticket in the 1864 presidential election, as well as in elections after the war, such as for Garfield in the 1880 U.S. presidential election. The song was so popular that the music publisher had 14 printing presses going at one time and still could not keep up with demand. It is estimated that over 700,000 copies of this song were put in circulation.

And the following candidates can be ruled out, as they died as children before the existence of CDVs:

  - [Charles Warren](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/180635042/charles-warren) (30 Mar 1834 to 29 Jul 1835).
  
  - [George Thompson Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/78770528/george-thompson-mills) (11 May 1838 to 22 Dec 1840).

Mary (Mills) Warren appears to only have one sister that married, Martha Helme (Mills) Baker, whose identity and that of her husband was conjectured above. There is also a presumed photograph of Mary (Mills) Warren's brother [James Harrison Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/78770663/james-harrison-mills) (16 Aug 1835 to 03 Aug 1896) shown further down this essay, taken in 1879 which should also be considered.

This leaves the following as the most likely candidates to be in the last two portraits, along with their ages in 1865, within the estimated timeframe of the photographs:

  - [William Erastus Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/78770720/william-erastus-mills) (18 Apr 1820 to 28 Jul 1861), died at the age of 41 in 1861 when CDVs were still quite new, but several aspects of the photo of the bearded man (no border, vignette style, etc.) suggest the photo quite possibly could been taken in the early 1860's. Note that the 1861 publication of *The Commercial Advertiser Directory for the City of Buffalo* (archive.org) does not list Powelson as a photographer at all, and the entry for the Buell photography studio is listed as "Buell, Chas. W. photographer, 214 Main, h. 128 N. Division." (p133).
  
  - [Seth William Warren](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/113066557/seth-w-warren) (15 Mar 1841 to 19 May 1918), 24 years old in 1865.  
 
  - [John Smith Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/78770674/john-smith-mills) (15 Mar 1827 to 27 Apr 1906), 38 years old in 1865. 

  - [Thomas Helme Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/78770701/thomas-helme-mills) (08 Feb 1829 to 17 Jun 1896), 36 years old in 1865.

Based on this, I believe that it is most likely that the bearded man is John Smith Mills, and the clean shaven man is most likely Thomas Helme Mills. As will be shown below, Thomas's Buffalo Directory indicates Thomas Helme Mills lived in the family home at 111 Park Street in 1868, the year after his father William's death. Several John Mills are listed in the directories of the 1860s, although none can yet be confirmed as William's son.

These portraits as well as other information on the Buffalo Mills that are in the Queens collection were transferred there from The Buffalo History Museum in Buffalo NY.

<p>If I recall correctly, the photo of the house in Buffalo was the only thing we retained from the Mills family collection. Everything else, photos and papers, was transferred to Queens.

However, we do have other loose photos of individuals in A-Z order by surname. I checked and these are the only people named Mills:
<p>
</p>
<ul>
  <li> John H. Mills, Company D, appears to be a Civil War soldier portrait.</li>
  <li> Edward M. Mills, ca. 1915. He is a young man in this photo, so he is not the Edward Mills who died in 1908.</li>
  <li> Robert Mills, ca. 1880, as an elderly man.</li>

[William Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/78770560/william-mills) (17 Nov 1792, Smithtown NY to 15 Aug 1867, Buffalo NY) who was married on 19 Jan 1819 to [Deborah (Smith) Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/78770568/deborah-mills) (02 Dec 1798, Smithtown NY to 13 Jun 1882, Clarence NY), is Jonas Davis Mills' first cousin, and so, William Mills and Edward H. Mills are first cousins once removed. William, Deborah, and their descendants lived in the Clarence and Buffalo areas during a time when Edward H. Mills' family was living in Corfu, a short distance away.

William was born at Mills Pond specifically, and he was a soldier in the War of 1812. (Index of Awards on Claims of the Soldiers of the War of 1812, New York Adjutant General's Office, New York State Archives, Albany NY, ancestry.com.) 


In 1850, William and Deborah are living in Newstead NY, and William is listed as a farmer. Later, William becomes a judge in Clarence. Newstead is on the *eastern* side of Clarence, the side closest to Corfu.

<p>The town of Newstead was established in 1823 as the "Town of Erie" from the eastern part of the town of Clarence. In 1831, the town's name was changed to "Newstead", reportedly on the advice of Abigail Fillmore, who was fond of the poetry of Lord Byron.

I believe that the man standing in front of 111 Park Street home could be William and Deborah's son, [James Harrison Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/78770663/james-harrison-mills) (16 Aug 1835 to 03 Aug 1896), who appears to have moved to Buffalo as early as 1863, and was associated with 111 Park possibly as early as 1866 and through to the early 1880's, overlapping the time the photograph was purportedly taken. The city directories below confirm what is indicated in Deborah's obituary: "Mrs. Mills, with her husband, moved to this city in 1865...". In 1865 James and his parents live at "North Pearl near Virginia" and in 1866, the first explicit references to Park Street appear. 

In Buffalo, James initially worked as a clerk at two different **general stores**, first Hamlin & Mendsen at 206 to 212 Main street, then Adam, Meldrum & Co, later called Adam, Meldrum & Anderson at 396 to 402 Main Street, American Block. (In 1867, a new dry goods store, Adam, Meldrum & Whiting opened at 308 and 310 Main Street, American Block.) In later years, James would distinguish himself in the real estate and loan brokerage businesses. 

In James' obituary he is described as being "quite sparsely built" and in Dec 1879, when the photograph of the home was purportedly taken, he was 44 years old:

{{% fig "mills-family/buffalo/111-park-street-buffalo-ny-closeup" "500" /%}}

<figure>
<blockquote>
Mr. Mills was 68 years old, He was born in the village of Clarence, and came to Buffalo when a young man. He found employment with Adam, Meldrum & Anderson, and remained with that firm for 20 years. He resigned his position 10 years ago to embark in the real estate business.

Therefore, the evidence suggests a likely overlap of 2-3 years when [Edward's family lived in Corfu NY]({{% relref "corfu" %}}) (likely beginning sometime in the Fall of 1862 to the Spring of 1863) and William's family lived in Clarence (leaving for Buffalo in 1865). The distance between Corfu and Clarence is approximately 10 miles , and the distance between Corfu and Buffalo is approximately 30 miles. Yet the above mentioned genealogy that was a "review and amplification" of James' research only has [a partial listing]({{% relref "smithtown" %}}) for Edward, not even noting his first marriage. This initially suggested to me that Edward's and William's branches of the Mills family may not have been aware of each other, but this has since been tempered with the realization that in the same volume that purportedly includes James' research, his own immediate family is underrepresented:

These may be the first references to 111 Park Street in relation to the Mills. 111 Park Street could be described as "above" or "near" Allen Street. 49 Park Street, mentioned in William Mills’ obituary in Aug 1867, is south of Allen and could also be described as “near”. (Using Google Maps as my reference, it seems that both street names and numbers have remained consistent to the present.)

James first married Laura (Love) Warren (1822? to 14 Oct 1850) on 31 Oct 1845, and they had one son [Orsamus George Warren](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/113110848/orsamus-george-warren) (21 Jul 1846 to 06 May 1892), presumably named for his grandfather. After Laura's death, James married [Mary Smith (Mills) Warren](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/113110177/mary-smith-warren) (19 Jun 1831 to 06 Apr 1894), daughter of William and Deborah Mills, on 05 Sep 1852, with whom he had one son, [William Candee Warren](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/113110044/william-candee-warren) (04 Aug 1859 to 27 Nov 1935)–again, presumably named for his grandfather,–and two daughters, [Kate (Warren) Bromley](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/9366865/kate-bromley) (17 Oct 1861 to 19 Jan 1945) and [Mary Hellen (Warren) Vought](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/113109793/mary-helen-vought) (18 Nov 1868 to 23 Mar 1959).

James Warren was obviously a very high-profile public figure, and by all accounts a highly successful and respected business man and political leader as well as a loving and devoted family man. He was a "self-made man" who came from humble beginnings, the son of a farmer and **general store proprietor** who was one of the pioneers of western New York. He was known as a man of exceptional honesty and integrity, as well as for his fairness even when dealing with his most ardent political rivals. He had many friendships and acquaintances, and his support and loyalty to his friends so endeared him to them, that even his political opponents spoke effusively about their sense of loss at his passing. He was known to be highly intelligent and plain spoken. Many noted that he seemed to have an unusually deep understanding of human psychology and behavior, which made him a natural political leader and business manager. It was said a number of times that he was a selfless man who always acted in service of his community.  He was physically robust and vigorous to the point that it was noted by many people, adding to the shock of his sudden passing.

<blockquote>
One of the best and most valuable citizens Buffalo ever had was lost when at half-past eight o'clock last evening, at his residence on North street, JAMES D. WARREN died. He had lain for several weeks on a bed of extreme suffering, with life from day to day trembling in the balance—a report of slight improvement occasionally relieving the solicitude of the community, only to be quickly followed by the intelligence that the promise of the symptoms had proven fallacious—yet to those who saw him but a comparatively little while ago in apparently rugged health and with an intellect a tower of strength, his taking off must seem a sudden dispensation. In the city of his home MR. WARREN’s death will be universally mourned; and the mourning will extend far beyond its borders, for his acquaintance throughout the state, and indeed the nation, was large, his reputation being that of a sturdily honest, and to an extent self-made man who did important service in the councils of the party of his preference and would perhaps have received high political honors had his life been prolonged. Quick witted, with broad intellectual grasp, and the peculiar faculty for managing men, MR. WARREN was long a recognized power in the local political and business spheres. He loved Buffalo and was always ready with his support for what he conceived to be its best interests.

An analysis of the quality of JAMES D. WARREN reveals him a man of commanding influence—a leader of men—of signal sagacity and prudence and unswerving attachment to causes he espoused and men he favored. No man in the state wielded larger influence in his local political community than he. Among the republicans of Erie county his will was law, for years; but he was never known to abuse his power or to forfeit the trust reposed in him. In the factional disturbances of the party in this state Mr. WARREN was pronounced in his position, but he never thereby lost the respect even of those who felt constrained to differ with him, and the <em>Democrat and Chronicle</em>, rarely in accord with him during the troublous period indicated, takes pleasure in testifying to this. He was a frank opponent, as well as a staunch friend. He enjoyed the friendship of President Arthur and many eminent public men. In his bearing he was urbane. As a citizen he was public-spirited, and in the domestic circle, exceedingly beloved. Fortune smiled upon him, and he was liberal in his charities. It was his pleasure to help others, and many are the men occupying places of trust and honor who own them to his kindly offices. Few men in the state will be more sadly missed than JAMES D. WARREN.

For even when past three-score MR. WARREN was a walking picture of robust health, a model of manly comeliness and strength. Few men of years could compare with him in those respects, and none of his age looked younger. He was made on a large scale, and up to the last two months looked good for another score years or more. There is something inexpressably sad in the thought of this strong man cut down so quickly in what seemed to be the very pride of his strength and the utmost height of his usefulness.

Of his influence within Republican politics, it is noted in several places that a national defeat for the party was attributed to the party not following one of his suggestions. Another added:

When Mr. James D. Warren sets about deciding on a senator, the senator he decides upon will get elected or there will be trouble.

It was repeatedly said that Warren himself did not have political ambitions, but that others pushed him toward high offices: 

<figure>
<blockquote>
Mr. Warren was prominently mentioned as a candidate for United States Senator when Mr. Evarts was elected, and was a candidate for Governor in the convention of 1885, receiving 138 votes. His name has also been mentioned in connection with the Senatorial election this year.

It was noted by several people that Warren did not want to make his final trip to New York, but felt compelled to do so, to say a final farewell to his close friend, the former President Chester Alan Arthur, and that the travel likely contributed to the severity of his illness.

<figure>
<blockquote>
In October last Mr. Warren went to New York, and had an affecting interview with the late ex-President Arthur. When taking his leave of him Mr. Warren could not restrain his feelings, realizing that it would be the last time he would ever see him on earth. Arthur took his hand in both of his, exclaiming, with deep emotion: "Warren, I love you, and always have."

The portrait of the late Ex-President Chester A. Arthur was draped with smilax. In this connection is it proper to state, that MR.

James D. Warren died 17 Dec 1886, a full month after Chester Arthur's death 18 Nov 1886. That such a secret could be kept for so long from the active newspaperman is suggestive of severe impairment over those final weeks.

[James Newsom Matthews](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/111297368/james-newson-matthews) (21 Nov 1828 to 20 Dec 1888) wrote this testament to his longtime friend and business partner, and for a time, his rival:

<figure>
<blockquote>
<p>
Elsewhere THE EXPRESS prints the particulars of his life. Here it is not intended to do more than to speak briefly of Mr. Warren's marked characteristics, as they struck one who was closely associated with him for fifteen years. The memory of those fifteen years of intimate friendship and perfect confidence is stronger and even fresher now, and will be more enduring, than the recollection of anything that has unpleasantly occurred between them in the nine years since.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Warren was eminently a man of business, with all of an upright business-man's keen regard for his commercial reputations. His financial credit was always higher than that of many men of double his wealth. It was his first concern. In business affairs he was prudent and discreet, and successful of course. He made few losses, and knew how to keep what he had gained. Those who think of him first as a politician, as so many will, mistake his leading trait. He was first of all a man of business. Circumstances not of his own choosing, made him a political leader, and for the last five years, hardly any Republican in the State of New-York wielded a greater influence than he easily exerted in shaping the party's action in its nominating conventions both local and national.
</p>
<p>
Yet, but ten years ago, it was difficult to persuade Mr. Warren to remain on the State Committee, and he had absolutely no political ambition. He cared nothing for political power or honor. Yet, within the last two or three years, he was a candidate for the highest honors and greatest leadership his party in this State could bestow. Such wonderful changes will a few years work in men and things! And yet he was peculiarly a man of common sense. Political ambition, if it was in him ever, was a plant of late growth and an exotic at that. If he sought office it was because other men sorely wanted him to have it.
</p>
<p>
Many friends who think they knew Mr. Warren pretty well will find it hard to believe all this of him. But it is the truth. He labored more zealously to promote other men's ambitions than his own. Left to his own devices he would lately have lived a life of ease, in the enjoyment of the wealth which he had acquired in honorable business pursuits. He was fond of home and simple surrounding. He was justly proud of his ownership of the <em>Buffalo Commercial Advertiser</em>, and the fine printing business and splendid building with which the time-honored title is identified. But he had no false pride of any kind. He felt himself the equal of most men, but was never lofty with the lowly. In his domestic relations his life was beyond reproach. He was devoted to wife and children and generous with those of his blood not so near or dear.
</p>
<p>
It has been thought of Mr. Warren and not altogether without reason, that he was fond of money. This brief sketch of his character may well be closed with a statement which proves that honor was dearer to him than money. Together with the present writer, as joint proprietor of the <em>Commercial</em>, the firm was once sued for libel with damages laid at a hundred thousand dollars. The evening before the case was to come of for trial, after many delays, the partner who had the greater moral responsibility for the trouble was informed by the plaintiff's distinguished counsel that if the <em>Commercial</em> would publish only a few lines, to the effect that upon documentary evidence submitted to its editor its proprietors had become convinced that the publication complained of was incorrect and unjust, the suit would be withdrawn. No apology was asked for. Upon the spur of the moment, without opportunity for consulting with Mr. Warren, the editor rejected the proposition. Evidence sufficient to convince him that, the plaintiff had been wronged could convince the jury, he said, and if the <em>Commercial</em> had done the plaintiff such a plain wrong as that, its proprietors ought to suffer for it and they were willing to pay the damages. Next morning, an hour or two before the case was called, Mr. Warren was informed of what his partner had done. "What would <em>you</em> have said?" asked the editor. "Just what you said!" answered Mr. Warren instantly. "But suppose they get a verdict, what then?" "Why then, by –, we’ll pay it!” said Mr. Warren, with an oath which had in it no flavor of impiety. 
</p>
<p>
That was the spirit of a proud, brave man, and the story is told here and now with a sort of sad pleasure in the reminiscence. Mr. Warren surely did not love money too well in that case. He was loyal and steadfast in the hour of trial. And perhaps some of his many friends will be glad to be told, or reminded that the libel suit was tried most ably on both sides, and that the verdict was “For the Defendants.”

I think the disputes between Warren and Matthews that appear in print are pretty one-sided. I have never seen a harsh word about Matthews from James D. Warren’s pen (which is not to say none exists). By most accounts James was a conciliator. Certainly, his role in the Blaine presidential campaign indicates that he was. Its notable that Matthews’s post-mortem encomium puts such emphasis on business and politics and remains silent on editing and writing. The other very interesting episode in James D. Warren’s life is the role he played in the senatorial races that were put in play by the resignation of Conkling and Platt. I’ll be happy to share the material I have if you decide to pursue the matter.

Orsamus George Warren, known to friends simply as “O. G.”, died six years after his father, but in that time faithfully continued his father’s example, as a businessman, a political leader, and a loyal friend beloved by many. The Commercial continued to gain prominence under Orsamus’ leadership, and when he died both the quantity and the nature of the memorials closely mirrored his father’s.

The Commercial fittingly wrote Orsamus’ best biography:

<figure>
<blockquote>
<p>    
Orsamus George Warren was born in Clarence, Erie County, July 21st, 1846, and was the eldest son of the late James D. Warren and Laura Love, his first wife. Orsamus attended school at Clarence and at the age of ten years came to Buffalo and attended school here. He also spent a year at the Canandaigua Academy. At the age of 17 he went to Europe with the late James N. Matthews, and made an extended tour of the continent. He also spent several months in study at Paris. 
</p>
<p>
On his return to Buffalo, in 1867, he entered the counting room of the COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER office as a bookkeeper, the firm at that time being Matthews & Warren. His connection with the establishment continued uninterrupted to the day of his death. When his father, the late James D. Warren, became sole proprietor, the son became his business manager and practical associate. James D. Warren died December 17th, 1886, and the firm of James D. Warren’s Sons was thereafter formed, composed of Orsamus G. and Wm. C. Warren, and thus continued to this day. 
</p>
<p>
Mr. Warren was married October 22nd, 1875, to Elizabeth Griffin, daughter of the late John B. Griffin. Mrs. Warren survives, also four children, three daughters and one son—Gertrude, Helen, Elizabeth, and James D. Warren, Jr. 
<p>
</p>
Mr. Warren became the successor of his father in Republican political leadership. He was for several years a member of the State Committee, and a delegate to State Conventions. He was a delegate from this district to the National Republican Convention of 1888, and had recently been elected a delegate to the Convention of 1892.  
</p>
<p>
He was for eight years a member of the Executive Committee of the State Associated Press, and served last year as President of the Association, retiring at the annual meeting held last month in New York. 
</p>
<p>
Mr. Warren was identified With many large business interests, in addition to his proprietorship of the COMMERCIAL. He was vice-president of the Buffalo Natural Gas Fuel Company, a director of the American Exchange Bank, a trustee of the Buffalo Savings Bank, vice-president of the Depew Improvement Company, and a director of the Bellevue Land Company.  
</p>
<p>
He was also a member of the Buffalo Club and of the Country Club.  Mr. Warren had the reputation of being a far-seeing and remarkably sagacious man of business. In social life he was of a most amiable disposition, and the friends who knew and loved him know best, though they can hardly realize at present, what a loss they have sustained.

As noted above, Orsamus was accompanied on his European trip by his father’s then business partner and eventual rival, James Matthews, whose son, [George Edward Matthews](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/111297478/george-edward-matthews) (17 Mar 1855 to 11 Jun 1911), was a close friend of Orsamus. George followed his father in the newspaper business just as Orsamus had his. 

<figure>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Buffalo Press Club held a meeting on Saturday to adopt resolutions of sympathy with the family of Mr. Warren. 
</p>
<p>
George E. Matthews of the Express was the first speaker, and he said it was hard for him to speak about Mr. Warren, for they had been friends from boyhood, and in many respects Mr. Warren had acted as his elder brother. 
</p>
<p>
“Certainly,” said he, “no one could have been kinder or more helpful than he was to me. When we became men our affairs in life were separate, but I do not think that either of us ever forgot our old friendship and personally our friendship was always of the sincerest kind.

<p>
Three or four years before his father’s death he became practically the manager of the concern. The senior Warren still visited the office and gave a general direction to affairs, but to his eldest son he committed all the details and executive work, giving him also an interest in the business. The two sons became the sole owners of the newspaper and printing house on the death of their father. 
</p>
<p>
O. G. Warren was an excellent business man. He received a thorough education in the counting room from his father. He was systematic and had aptitude, discernment and good judgment. He was a director of the American Exchange Bank, and last year was president of the New York Associated Press.
</p>
<p>
…Though Mr. Warren never held office, and never sought one, he was active in politics and influential in getting places for his friends. He succeeded his father as member of the State Committee from this district and held the place until last fall, when he declined to serve longer, and in his place John N. Scatcherd was elected. Mr. Warren was a delegate to every State convention since his father’s death. While he was on the State Committee he was a member of the Executive Committee. He was a delegate to the National convention of 1888, and a delegate-elect to the convention which is to meet June 7 at Minneapolis. 
</p>
<p>
He was fond of society and had many warm friends, not only in this city but also throughout the State.

<p>
Whatever he did was done thoroughly; always alert, enterprising and straightforward. In every relation of life Mr. Warren won and held the friendship and confidence of the men with whom he came into contact. He was always sincere, true to his convictions, and steadfast in the purposes to which his judgment committed him. Mr. Warren, at the death of his honored father, was placed in a most critical position as the director of a great newspaper property and the undisputed leader of the republican party. How well he executed the trusts confided to him we ail know. 
</p>
<p>
It is not always an advantage to be the son of a distinguished father. It is common for the merits of the son to suffer injustice by comparison, but our friend was a man of uncommon intensity of purpose; his individuality was so strong that he needed no reflected light to make him a leader of men and a sagacious business man.

These three references to his recent movements hint at the things he was, the things he loved, the things he did in life—outside of his home. First he was a newspaperman. He came up to that estate by his father’s side—by the side of a rare father, for such was James D. Warren—who inducted his son successively into journalism of an admirable sort, then into politics, and transferred to him at death the mantle of undisputed leadership in the County of Erie, and concurrently placed upon his shoulders and in his hands the responsibilities and substance of accumulated wealth and the open opportunities of enhancing it. The years can be counted on one’s fingers since the most of this came to O. G. Warren. He pushed on the newspaper, the BUFFALO COMMERCIAL to increased deserving in public estimation; he held the attachment of the party as his father had done; and he was singularly fortunate in investments coupled to Buffalo’s growth and the promotion of it, so that he lays down a fortune larger than that which fell to his brother and himself at a date comparatively recent.

The Warren and Mills family stayed close together. Both James D. Warren and his son William C. Warren lived in houses on North Street very close to its intersection with Park Street, where the Mills houses are located. James D. Warren’s house is known to us only from photographs (see attached), but The William C. Warren House is extant. Also, the vandalized headstone of James Warren (James D. Warren’s grandfather) that I mentioned is located on Allegany Road as it passes through Darien (just a few miles south of Corfu), a picture of that is in “Southern Pilgrimage.” I wish I had some way to confirm that the William and Deborah Mills are the sitters in the first two carte de visite portraits. …It is unlikely anyone in the family will recognize the portraits, but I will check around. The lack of correspondence between the list of William and Deborah’s children in the 1850 census and the published genealogy is curious.

<blockquote>
<p>
WILLIAM C. WARREN, editor and publisher of the Buffalo Commercial, is one of the foremost newspaper men of Western New York, a leading Republican and a citizen prominent in the business, political and social life of Buffalo. Mr. Warren is in the prime of years and vigor and is probably the youngest of Buffalo's newspaper proprietors. His ability as a journalist may be characterized as a natural result of inheritance and environment. The name of Warren is one of the oldest in the history of Buffalo newspaper enterprise, and the subject of this sketch was brought up in an atmosphere of journalism and became familiarized in early life with the duties of editor and publisher. In both capacities he has won decisive success, and his newspaper pursuits have run parallel with a current of equally notable activities in politics and public affairs. 
<p>
</p>
Mr. Warren was born in Buffalo on the 4th of August, 1859, and has always made the Queen City his home. His father was James D. Warren, for many years editor and proprietor of the Commercial Advertiser. William C. Warren received his early education in the Buffalo public schools, attended Briggs Classical School, and graduated from the scientific department of Yale University in 1880. He then became associated in the management of the Commercial Advertiser, which after the death of the senior Warren in 1886 was continued by his sons under the firm style of James D. Warren's Sons. In 1890 the word "Advertiser" was dropped and the paper has since been known as the Commercial. Since the death of Orsamus G. Warren, William C. Warren has been managing proprietor. 
<p>
</p>
As an editor and publisher, Mr. Warren is the vigorous, modern type of newspaper man. He has maintained the sterling traditions of his paper and has given it the distinctive impress of his personality. The staunch Republicanism of the Commercial Advertiser is perpetuated and emphasized in its successor, the Commercial, which has for many years been the representative newspaper of its party in this section of the State. Viewed as to its general policy the Commercial is characterized by progressiveness tempered by sound conservatism. The public spirit of its proprietor is reflected in his paper whose championship of the interests of Buffalo and Erie County is zealous, efficient, and unswerving in its constancy. The influence of the Commercial in politics has long been one of the important and well recognized factors of existing conditions. A man of clear-cut views and definite political convictions, the editorial opinions of Mr. Warren carry the weight which attaches to utterances which deal frankly with issues and are founded on experience and practical knowledge.
<p>
</p>
From the beginning of his active career Mr. Warren has been a leading figure in Republican politics. For many years he was the adviser and political associate of John R. Hazel, then the recognized leader of the Republican party in Erie County. Prior to 1898 Mr. Warren, though wielding a large influence, had not held an official position in the party organization, and he has never at any time been a candidate for public office. In the Republican State Convention, held at Saratoga in 1898, the delegates from the 33d Congressional District elected him to succeed James A. Roberts as State Committeeman, and he continued to serve in that capacity for eight years, winning a high reputation for tact and sagacity as a party manager. When John R. Hazel was elevated to the Federal Bench in 1900, Mr. Warren was chosen as the man best fitted to be his successor as the Republican leader of Erie County.
<p>
</p>
In addition to his newspaper and printing business Mr. Warren is interested in the Buffalo General Electric Co., of which he is a Director. He is a member of the Saturn and Country clubs of Buffalo, and the University Club of New York City. 
<p>
</p>
On April 2, 1891, Mr. Warren married Miss Clara Davock, daughter of John Davock of Buffalo.

Although I don’t think I have seen anything explicitly connecting the two men, circumstantial evidence strongly suggests that William C. Warren and [Isaac H. Bromley](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/9366864/isaac-h-bromley) (09 Nov 1856 to 29 Jul 1932) were close friends from college, attending Yale University at the same time: William graduated in 1880 and Isaac in 1881. After graduation, Isaac worked for his father, an editor at the New York Tribune, before joining the Buffalo Commercial, where William was already working for his father James D. Warren. Isaac married William’s sister, [Kate (Warren) Bromley](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/9366865/kate-bromley) (17 Oct 1861 to 19 Jan 1945) in 1883.

## More on James Dunlap Warren

<figure>
<blockquote>
<p>
JAMES D. WARREN was a representative figure in Buffalo journalism. As editor and proprietor of the Buffalo Commercial Advertiser, now the Commercial, Mr. Warren was widely known in the newspaper world and he was equally prominent in public life.
<p>
</p>
Mr. Warren was born in Bennington, Wyoming County, N.Y., January 19th, 1823. His father, Orsamus Warren, was a farmer and one of the pioneers of Western New York. From Bennington the family removed to Wales, Erie County, and later to Clarence, where Orsamus Warren bought a farm and carried on a store. When his father came to Erie County James D Warren was about two years old. As a boy he attended school, worked on the farm and assisted his father in his business. When twenty years old he made a tour of the South, spending a year in Natchez, Miss. Returning North, for a number of years he engaged in mercantile and farming pursuits in Clarence. Meantime he became active in politics and served several terms as Supervisor. In 1854 he was elected County Treasurer for a term of three years. Subsequently he held for two or three terms the office of Clerk of the Board of Supervisors. 
<p>
</p>
In 1861 Mr. Warren began his life work as editor and publisher. In April of that year, with Rufus Wheeler and Joseph Candee, he became joint purchaser of the Buffalo Commercial Advertiser, with which newspaper he continued to be identified till his death. The history of this paper began in 1811, when it was founded as the Buffalo Gazette. It passed into the hands of a succession of owners, from a weekly became a daily, and was issued as the Daily Commercial Advertiser on the 1st of January, 1835. In May, 1839, the Buffalo Journal was merged with the Commercial Advertiser. In 1862 Mr. Candee withdrew from the business, his interest being purchased by Messrs. Warren and Wheeler. Immediately afterward Mr. James N. Matthews was admitted to partnership, the firm becoming Wheeler, Matthews & Warren. Two years, later Mr. Wheeler retired and the firm was styled Matthews & Warren. In 1877 Mr. Warren purchased the interest of Mr. Matthews and from that time was the sole proprietor and publisher of the Commercial Advertiser. Under his management the paper became the leading Republican newspaper of Western New York. As an editor Mr. Warren won and retained a distinctive place as a stalwart exponent of Republican principles and as a broad minded representative of the best interests of the community. His conception of journalism was high and he maintained his ideals with unfaltering constancy. Originally in Main street, the plant of the Commercial Advertiser was removed in 1868 to the Adams Block in Washington street. In September of the same year the building was destroyed by fire. It was promptly rebuilt and the establishment continued to occupy it till April 10, 1882, when the business was removed to its present new building at Washington and North Division streets. 
<p>
</p>
In addition to his newspaper interests, Mr. Warren was President of White's Bank, then one of the well known financial institutions of Buffalo. 
<p>
</p>
Mr. Warren had an active share in Republican party management, was Chairman and for many years a member of the State Committee, and on numerous occasions served as a delegate to State and national conventions. He was what was known as a stalwart Republican, and was the recognized leader of that branch of the party in Western New York. 
<p>
</p>
Mr. Warren was married twice. His first wife, to whom he was married October 31, 1845, was Miss Laura Love, daughter of George Love of Buffalo. She died in 1849, leaving one son, Orsamus G. Warren. In 1851 Mr. Warren married for his second wife Miss Mary Mills, daughter of Judge Mills of Clarence, N. Y. The children of this union were one son William C. Warren and two daughters, Miss Kate and Miss Mary Warren of Buffalo.
<p>
</p>
The death of James D. Warren occurred on the 16th of December, 1885.

I have quite a lot of information about James D. Warren, his antecedents, and his descendants, including some letters to him from prominent political figures and some letters written to his parents, Orsamus (1800-1876) and Nancy Warren. Also there is a big and disappointingly inconclusive genealogical file compiled by my grandfather, who hired a professional genealogist to untangle our American origins.

James D. Warren’s great-great grandson, Charles D. Warren wrote a detailed and compelling history that features letters written by James D. Warren on his trip to Nachez MS. These letters along with other artifacts and original research by Charles completely recasts the Warren genealogy prior to James D. Warren’s grandfather.

<blockquote>
We have Emily Wettlaufer to thank for seeing to the safekeeping of James D. Warren’s letters and other family documents. Among them, are two letters from James’s 1840-41 trip to Nachez, Mississippi, which provide a glimpse of his personality and some clues to Warren genealogy.

James D. Warren was the leader of what was known as the “Stalwart” branch of the Republican Party:

<figure>
<blockquote>
The Stalwarts were a faction of the Republican Party that existed briefly in the United States during as well as after Reconstruction and the Gilded Age during the 1870s and 1880s. Led by U.S. Senator Roscoe Conkling—also known as "Lord Roscoe"—Stalwarts were sometimes called Conklingites. ... Stalwarts were the "traditional," "Old Guard" Republicans who advocated for the civil rights of African-Americans and opposed Rutherford B. Hayes's efforts to enact civil service reform. They were pitted against the "Half-Breeds" (classically liberal moderates) for control of the Republican Party. The most prominent issue between Stalwarts and Half-Breeds was patronage. The Half-Breeds worked to enact moderate civil service reform, and finally helped pass the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act. This was signed by Arthur, who became President after the assassination of James A. Garfield, a Half-Breed. Stalwarts favored traditional machine politics.
