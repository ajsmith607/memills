The following is the research I accumulated on Robert Mills prior to determining that he was likely out-of-scope for this work. As far as I can tell, [Robert Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/77507182/robert-mills) (17 Nov 1824 to 11 Dec 1890) is not a descendant of Timothy Mills of Mills Pond, although he may be a descendant of John Mills "who was made freeman of Boston in 1632". (Genealogies of Long Island Families, p105.)

Robert Mills and James D. Warren were both among the elite business men of Buffalo at the same time, and both were very active in Republican politics, so the two men must have been well acquainted.
