<p>
SAMUEL WICKHAM MILLS, D.D., one of the highly respected citizens of Port Jervis, is a native of Orange County, born in the town of Wallkill, near Scotchtown, five miles north of Middletown, on the 5th of April, 1820, and is a son of Samuel and Esther (Stitt) Mills. His mother was a daughter of John and Nancy (McCullough) Stitt, of Bloomingburg, Sullivan County, N. Y. The Mills family came from Yorkshire, England. Some of the name are of Holland extraction, the first to come to America being Peter Vander Mulin (the name meaning “from the mills”), who settled in Windsor, Conn., where the family took the English name of Mills. The English family can be traced back to the De Molis, founded in 1083, in Devon, England, the name being derived from Meulles of Normandy. Members of the family bearing that name went to England with William the Conqueror in 1066. The name has several times been changed, being Milne in 1530, Mills in 1560, Millne in 1584, Milles in 1612, and Mylle from 1627.to 1665, these being found in the records of Yorkshire, England. 
</p>
<p>
John Mills came with Governor Winthrop to Massachusetts in 1629 or 1630, his name appearing thirty-third on the roll of the first church of Boston, in which church his two daughters, Joy and Remembrance, were baptized in October, 1630. He became a freeman of Boston in 1632, but later removed to Braintree, Mass., where he served as Township Clerk in 1653. His will was made in 1670, and he left his estate to his son John, asking also that one of John’s sons be educated for the ministry, as many of his predecessors were of that profession. Richard Mills was a pioneer schoolmaster on Long Island and in Connecticut. Samuel Mills, of Dedham, Mass., and Samuel Mills, of Windsor, Conn., came from England at an early date, but it is not known whether they were related to the branch of the family to which our subject belongs. George Mills, who was probably the ancestor of the Long Island branch, came from Yorkshire, England, about 1665, and died in Jamaica, L. I., in 1694, at the age of eighty-nine years. He is supposed to have been a brother of John Mills, of Boston. 
</p>
<p>
From George, in a direct line to our subject, are Samuel, Jonathan, Timothy, Jonathan, Jacob and Samuel, the latter the father of our subject. George’s son Samuel was born on Long Island in 1631, and died in Jamaica, L. I., in 1726, at the age of ninety-five, a notice of his death appearing in the New York Gazette, March 12, 1726. He had sixteen children, nine of whom were living at the time of his death, together with eighty grandchildren and fifty-four great-grandchildren. His son Jonathan was born at Jamaica, N. Y., was married in 1710, and had four children: Timothy, Samuel, Isaac and Jonathan. The records show that he purchased a piece of land March 3, 1677. Timothy, born in 1677, left Jamaica and settled at Mills’ Pond in 1693, to which he gave the name. He died March 30, 1751. His first wife, Elizabeth, had two children, and the second wife, Sarah, had eleven. Jonathan, the sixth ‘of the latter marriage, was born October 23, 1710, and was married in 1737 to Ruth Rudyard, of Perth Amboy, N. J. They had six children, and after her death he was again married, January 25, 1756, this time to Dorothy Miller, and to them were born three children. His death occurred at Mills’ Pond, October 23, 1798. Of the first marriage, Jacob and Timothy were twins, born December 22, 1746. 
</p>
<p>
At the age of nineteen Jacob Mills began whaling, which he followed for six or seven months out of the year. He came to Orange County between 1768 and 1770, near New Windsor, and started a tannery. When he first moved here he bought twenty-two hundred and fifty acres of land in the town of Wallkill, five miles north of Middletown, and the place was known as Millsburg. On the 27th of December, 1773, he was married, in Goshen, to Catherine Denton. During the Revolutionary War he made shoes for the soldiers of the militia company to which he belonged, and received his pay in Continental money, which was worth but very little. His company was ordered to Ft. Montgomery, but it was captured before they arrived. His tannery was enlarged, and in 1791 he built a stone house near the same, and there our subject was born. He occupied that house until 1807, when he erected a large frame dwelling. He died at the home of his son Charles, in 1841, at the age of ninety-five years. He was quite a liberal man, and assisted largely in building the Presbyterian Church at Scotchtown. In his family were twelve children, six sons and six daughters, and with the exception of Catherine all reared families of their own. William Wickham was the only one that did not live in Orange County. He made his home on Long Island, where he was heir to his uncle’s property at Mills’ Pond. At the time of his death Jacob Mills had ninety-seven grandchildren, forty-eight grandsons and forty-nine granddaughters, nearly all of whom became farmers. There was one physician, one clergyman, and one Sheriff of Orange County. 
</p>
<p>
Samuel Mills, the father of our subject, succeeded to the old home place. He was born August 27, 1776, and died on the 13th of November, 1860, at the age of eighty-five. He cast his last vote just before his death. On the 13th of January, 1807, he married Esther Stitt, who was born August 28, 1787, and her death occurred November 11, 1863. Of their family we note the following: Catherine married Archibald Slaughter, and died June 8, 1888, in her eighty-first year; Nancy, wife of Hiram S. Dunning, died in her thirty-fourth year, March 3, 1843; William died October 31, 1885, at Petersburg, Va., in his seventy-sixth year; Caroline, wife of DeWitt Slaughter, died November 9, 1861, in her fiftieth year; Mary Jane, the wife of Robert J. Bull, of Wallkill, is now in her eighty-first year; John Stitt died when young; Sarah Elizabeth, who was the wife of Gen. Alfred D. Hurtin, died April 24, 1886, in her seventieth year; Jacob Stitt passed away when young; Samuel Wickham is next in order of birth; James Jackson lives at Scotchtown; Albert died on the old homestead in his sixty-sixth year, July 25, 1890, where his widow still resides; Edwin lives near Phillipsburg, this county; and Ruth died in childhood. The father of this family carried on a tannery and also engaged in farming, owning a large tract of land, which comprised three farms. He was quite a successful business man, and assisted his children very materially. 
</p>
<p>
We now come to the personal history of Rev. Samuel Wickham Mills. He was the ninth in the family, and remained at home until reaching the age of fifteen, when he entered Rutgers College at New Brunswick, N. J., from which he was graduated in the Class of ’38, at the age of eighteen. He then began studying in the Theological Seminary of the Reformed Church at New Brunswick, from which he was graduated in 1842. Among his classmates at Rutgers there were many who afterward became quite noted, among them being John DeWitt, who became Professor of Ancient Languages at the Theological Seminary at New Brunswick; Theodoric R. Westbrook, Supreme Judge of New York, who made his home at Kingston, this state, and died while serving on the Bench; and Dr. James A. H. Cornell, a minister of New Baltimore, N. Y., who has been quite prominent in church work in the state. Upon his graduation from college he was awarded the English salutatory, which at that time was third in the list of honors conferred by the faculty of the college. 
</p>
<p>
At Bloomingburg, Sullivan County, in May, 1843, Mr. Mills was ordained and began his pastoral work. At the end of fifteen years he located at Port Jervis, where he engaged in preaching for fourteen years, or until 1872, the date of his arrival here being in February, 1858. He here erected the present Reformed Church edifice at a cost of $44,000, one of the, principal contributors being Henry H. Farnham, who gave $13,000, besides a fine organ. The architect was Isaac G. Perry, the present Capital Commissioner of Albany, and a noted man. Rev. Mr. Mills was very fortunate in the erection of the church, as the entire amount of its construction was obtained before the dedication. During his ministry here he received two hundred and forty-nine-members into the church. Of late he has had no charge, but does supply duty, and has preached in nearly all of the churches in this section of the country. He is a member of the classis of Orange, in the higher judicatories of the Reformed Church, and during his pastorates, as well as since, has represented the same. He gives entire satisfaction wherever he goes, and is an untiring worker among all classes. He has served as President of the Minisink Valley Historical Society since its organization in 1889. For thirty-seven years, or up to June, 1895, he was Corresponding Secretary of the Orange County Bible Society, and then was made President of the society. 
</p>
<p>
Rev. Mr. Mills was married, on the 17th of January, 1844, to Miss Almeda J. Bailey, a daughter of Nathaniel Bailey, of Middletown, and a sister of Daniel H. Bailey, later Mayor of the same city. She was born February 28, 1822, and her death occurred on the 12th of March, 1867. By her marriage she became the mother of six children: Harriet Bailey, who died in childhood on the 2d of April, 1847; Esther, the wife of C. E. Cuddeback, an attorney of Port Jervis; Anna, whose death occurred April 5, 1879, at the age of twenty-nine years; Theodore Denton, a doctor of Middletown; Cornelia Hunter, who died November 24, 1871, at the age of seventeen years; and Mary Delia, wife of J. Alex Stitt, an attorney of New York City. On the 29th of November, 1870, Rev. Mr. Mills was again, married, Miss Amira St. John becoming his wife. She is a daughter of Stephen St. John, of Port Jervis. 
</p>
<p>
Mr. Mills is a well read, cultured gentleman, and a natural pulpit orator. His record has been an honorable one, his years have been fruitful with deeds of usefulness and kindness, with malice towards none and friendliness towards all who have come under his influence, and he has gained the respect and honor of the whole community. He is now living in his handsome residence on the main street of Port Jervis, lying at the foot of the mountain, which looms grandly above it for several hundred feet, and is surrounded by beautiful grounds. In this lovely spot he intends to spend his remaining days.

## The Seawanhaka Disaster

As Reverend Mills notes in *Mills Genealogy* above, his cousin [Horatio W. Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/68729755/horatio-w-mills) (21 Oct 1837 to 28 Jun 1880), son of [William Wickham Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/68729507/william-wickham-mills) (03 Sep 1797 to 06 Jan 1865) of [Mills Pond]({{% relref "smithtown" %}}), “drowned in Seawanhaka disaster in Long Island Sound” on his way to Mills Pond. 

<figure>
<blockquote>
On June 28, 1880, a boiler aboard the steamboat Seawanhaka exploded while the boat was in the East River near Wards Island, New York City, setting the boat on fire and resulting in the deaths of 24 to 35 people. A coroner's jury found that although the boiler had passed inspection the prior March and should have been in good working condition, the loss of life was exacerbated by the poor discipline of the boat crew following the explosion.

Prior to colonization by European settlers more than 300 years ago, Long Island was home to thirteen Native American tribes. Long Island was initially known as “Sewanhacky,” the name signifying the abundance of quahog, or hard clam, on the island, which the tribes used to make “wampum,” that they used as money.

<blockquote>
<p>The Seawanhaka was one of many steamships that shuttled commuters and daytrippers to and from Manhattan, Whitestone, Great Neck, Sand's Point, Glen Cove, Sea Cliff, Glenwood, and Roslyn.  In the days before highways, affordable autos, and commuter railroads like the LIRR,  steamships were a major way for people to travel longer distances.  
</p>
<p>
The waterways of New York City and its surrounding areas were full of steamships, which were full of passengers and cargo.  These waterways became increasingly dangerous, as more and more steamships and other boats competed for limited shipping lanes and rights of way.  Many serious steamship catastrophes, and many more small accidents and near misses, occurred in and around the waters of New York City.

<blockquote>
<p>
In the late afternoon of June 28, 1880, the steamship Seawanhaka was making its regular trip up the East River from its last Manhattan boarding dock to Long Island, with many commuters aboard.  As the ship sailed into the narrows between Hell Gate and Little Hell Gate, her boiler caught fire.  Flames quickly spread to the ship’s other decks.  With no docks in sight, and heavy boat traffic on both sides, Captain Charles P. Smith piloted his ship to the wetland shore of Randall’s Island.  He ran the Seawanhaka aground in a spot called the sunken meadow.  Half the ship sat on marshland; the other half faced the waters of the East River.  Captain Smith stayed with his ship until he blacked out.  He had been badly burned on the face and hands while steering his ship to the best landing site available.
</p>
<p>
Those fleeing the Seawanhaka were forced to choose between a blazing, sinking ship, swampy marshland, and inhospitable waters - many could not swim.  Over forty people perished in the Seawanhaka fire, drowned fleeing the ship, or died from injuries suffered in the disaster, including several Great Neck residents.

On the entire front page of the 29 Jun 1880 edition of The New York Times, only news of the Seawanhaka disaster was reported. The event and its aftermath were reported statewide for many months, including in newspapers in Tompkins, Erie, and Orange counties.

Initially nobody knew that Horatio Mills was a passenger on the boat, and his remains may not have been identified except for papers he was carrying when he died. (And even then, those papers would likely have been lost had Horatio's body been discovered first by the “river thieves”, "human ghouls" who "hunt[ed] the wreck of the Seawanhaka to rob the bodies of the victims".) Although Horatio was known to be a "very fine swimmer", a large bruise on his back suggested he was severely injured from striking the boat’s paddle wheel during his attempted escape.

Horatio was a Columbia educated lawyer "endowed with talents of the highest order".
