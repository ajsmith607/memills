Mary Emily Mills, born Dec 1858 Staten Island NY, died 03 Nov 1937 Brooktondale NY, who commonly went by Emily, and in more formal contexts, M. Emily Mills or M. E. Mills. Youngest child of Edward Hallock and Mary Ann Mills. Proprietor, [M. E. Mills]({{% relref "me-mills" %}}) general store in Brookton/Brooktondale NY. Active in the [temperance movement]({{% relref "temperance" %}}) in the Independent Order of Good Templars and the Women's Christian Temperance Union, as well as Sunday School teacher and piano player in Brooktondale Congregational Church, now Caroline Valley Community Church.

Emily's middle name may be in honor of Edward's sister who died over a decade before Emily was born. Presumably she went by Emily in casual circumstances to distinguish her from her mother, and in more formal contexts, she typically used "M. Emily Mills", particularly in later years.

Emily was baptized in the Reformed Dutch Church of Port Richmond on 30 Nov 1859, the last recorded baptism in the church that year. The timing of the baptism may be a clue to narrow her exact birthdate; perhaps this was the Sunday immediately prior to her first birthday. Otherwise, I do not have direct evidence of Emily attending church prior to her Brookton baptism.

Documentation suggests the Mills family moved from Staten Island to Corfu sometime between 01 Sept 1862 and 01 May 1863, a period overlapping Emily's fourth birthday. 

The family moved to Motts Corners in Mar 1879, which must have filled Emily with many mixed emotions.  Corfu was her childhood home, where she had attended school, and she was leaving behind friends that she would make return trips to visit. But it was also where [her brother Horace]({{% relref "mills-horace-f-1854" %}}) had killed himself just a few years prior.

This was also a few months after Emily's 20th birthday, and the move must have been an exciting one. Very soon after her arrival in Mott's Corners, Emily was actively involved in several community social groups, providing clues to her personality as a young woman. Emily was energetic, outgoing and appeared to make friends easily, and it seems she was welcomed warmly by her new neighbors.

Emily joined the existing “High Bridge Lodge No. 296” of the [Independent Order of Good Templars]({{% relref "temperance" %}}) shortly after arriving in Mott’s Corners, as she "furnished entertainment for the good of the order" in August 1879. (20 Aug 1879, Ithaca Daily Journal, Ithaca NY, p4.) The Good Templars often met above Edward Mills' store, "E. H. Mills", in a space for public events and private meetings called Lounsbery Hall, named for the owner of the building, Edward Lounsbery. Emily was a member until at least August 1886, as attested by the [meeting minutes of the Good Templars at that time]({{% relref "good-templars" %}}), and as the last Secretary of Lodge No. 296, she wrote the final three words recorded on 27 Aug 1886: "Emily Mills Sec.".  

Emily held a number of offices in the Lodge over the years, and as a result of her time as Secretary, there are many more examples of her distinctive handwriting preserved. 

{{% fig "temperance/1886-04-23" "800" /%}}

{{% fig "handwriting/sig3" "800" /%}}

The Good Templars' meetings were both entertaining and educational by design, to offer a compelling alternative to drinking establishments, and Emily often contributed literary items to the “Good of the Order” portions of meetings in which members volunteered in advance to read or recite a short piece, such as a poem or essay. In the preserved meeting minutes of the lodge, the items for the Good of the Order were only identified in a minority of cases, but in the period from Apr 1883 to Aug 1886, Emily provided the following works that I have tried to identify:

And on 15 Jan 1886: "Reading of a pleasant poem by Sis Mills". Years later, when Emily joined the Brookton chapter of the Women's Christian Temperance Union, she held offices in the chapter just as she had in the Templar's Lodge, including "Superintendent of Literature and Publications". 

Several large group photographs survive of members of various temperance groups in Caroline, and Emily may be among those pictured.

Emily was also involved in the Caroline Amateur Dramatic Club, along with George Richardson and other Good Templars members. The Club, along with Dr. Besemer's orchestra, gave several acclaimed performances of the play *The Colleen Bawn*, for the benefit of the Templars. Emily played supporting character "Sheelah".

> *The Colleen Bawn*, or *The Brides of Garryowen* is a melodramatic play written by Irish playwright Dion Boucicault. It was first performed at Laura Keene's Theatre, New York, on 27 March 1860 with Laura Keene playing Anne Chute and Boucicault playing Myles na Coppaleen. ...*The Colleen Bawn* captivated audiences with its interwoven character plots and overall story.

   - From [Wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Keene): "Laura Keene (20 July 1826 – 4 November 1873) was a British stage actress and theatre manager. In her twenty-year career, she became known as the first powerful female manager in New York. She is most famous for being the lead actress in the play *Our American Cousin*, which was attended by President Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theater in Washington on the evening of his assassination. ...In 1858, *Our American Cousin* debuted in Laura Keene's Theater. On the night of 14 April 1865, Keene's company, which primarily included John Dyott and Harry Hawk, were performing Our American Cousin at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. In attendance that night were President Abraham Lincoln and his wife First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln. Actor John Wilkes Booth fatally shot President Lincoln while Lincoln watched the play from the presidential box; Booth then fled the theatre. Amid the confusion, Keene made her way to the presidential box where Lincoln lay dying and cradled the mortally wounded President's head in her lap. President Lincoln's fatal head wound bled on her dress, staining her cuff. The cuff was later donated to the National Museum of American History."

Although not a large role, Sheelah is in key scenes and gave Emily an opportunity to deliver substantial dialogue, perform powerful emotions and even be involved in physical action. Here are some of the words spoken by Emily on those evenings in Jan and Feb 1880, in Lounsbery Hall at Mott's Corners, above her father Edward's store where she clerked:

<figure>

> *Sheelah* The poor Colleen! Oh, no, Danny, I knew she'd die of the love that was chokin’ her. He didn’t know how tindher she was when he gave her the hard word. What was that message the masther sent to her, that he wouldn't let me hear? It was cruel, Danny, for it broke her heart entirely; she went away that night, and, two days after, a cloak was found floatin’ in the reeds, under Brikeen Bridge; nobody knew it but me. I turned away, and never said—. The creature is drowned, Danny, and woe to them as dhruv her to it. She has no father, no mother to put a curse on him, but the Father above that niver spakes till the last day, and then

>—[*She turns and sees Danny gasping, his eyes fixed on her, supporting himself on his arm.*]

>Danny! Danny! he’s dyin’—he's dyin’!

The Good Templars may have also provided opportunities for Emily to travel, as the Good Templars commonly attended events at other Lodges in Tompkins County, cooperated with other temperance groups, and they sent representatives to the state "Grand Lodge" as well. Because of this, Emily may be present in some of the well known photographs of *other* temperance groups in Caroline. 

When Lodge No. 296 disbanded after Aug 1886, just over seven years after Emily joined, she must have keenly felt its absence in her life. From the information I have seen so far, I cannot say if she joined High Bridge Lodge again when it re-formed a few years later with the number 720. Emily eventually joined the WCTU, but I don't know when.

More information on Emily's activities in High Bridge Lodge–including more discussion of the items she furnished for the “Good of the Order”–and the WCTU, can be found in the following pages:

Emily is mentioned in the will of her uncle, Henry Higbie:

{{% fig "pine/1881-10-21-henry-higbie-will" "800" /%}}

Emily returned to Corfu in later years to bury Jonas, Mary Ann and Edward. She also returned to Corfu to visit her childhood friends.

{{% fig "1882-07-21-batavia-daily-news" "500" /%}}

At least by the 1890's, Emily was working as a clerk in her father's store, just as her older brothers had. (She may have always helped with the store, or perhaps she only began clerking in the store after Jonas died.) Several volumes of sales journals have survived from [M. E. Mills general store]({{% relref "me-mills" %}}) that are written by Emily's hand (and certainly Ellen Gould's handwriting must also be present in those books). 

Many aspects of Emily's handwriting are quite distinctive—such as uppercase E's, M's, W's, C's, T's and F's as well as lowercase p's are often written with similar idiosyncrasies. Note for example, the following page of entries in M. E. Mills sales journals, which appears to be entirely written by Emily.

{{% fig "me-mills/1909-03-26-sales-journal" "800" /%}}

Her E's C's L's and J's tend to have big loops. Her lowercase p's practically pierce the line above it. And her uppercase T's and F's have distinctive crosses that rise and fall. Her handwriting is easily recognizable, and when others (most likely Ellen Gould) make entries in the Mills' store journals, the differences are apparent.

Interestingly, her T's are sometimes written quite differently. See for example, the way "to" is written in the entries for John and James Caveny vs. those for J. T. Miller and Emily herself. These very different looking T's appear to all be written by Emily given other matches that can be verified, including most obviously, the capital J's which all begin in the center with an extra initial loop.

Jonas died on 14 October 1885 after a brief illness. Whether Emily worked in the store prior to Jonas' death, by 1892, she lists herself as clerk in the state census. 

A small glimpse of Emily's interests around that time:

Emily acted as nurse at the end of her mother's life: 

{{% fig "1895-12-31-daily-news-p1" "800" /%}}

In 1907, Emily was baptized and officially joined the membership roll of Brookton Congregational Church, along with 10 other single women, in a ceremony officiated by Reverend Annis Ford Eastman. A closer examination of the circumstances around the baptism can be found [here]({{% relref "baptism" %}}). It is unclear what Emily's religious outlook was before being baptized, but at least from that point on, Emily's faith was a very important part of her life.

This photo, taken on 13 Jun 1907 shows the Congregational Church as Emily knew it then, with the original steeple:

Emily, along with many of the others baptized with her, immediately became deeply involved in church activities, a level of commitment they sustained the rest of their lives. Emily was a Sunday School teacher, and possibly taught classes specifically for adults. There are newspaper accounts detailed below of her organizing bible study groups and prayer meetings in her home. In the following report, dated the eve of Edward's death, we see that in the months immediately after joining the church, Emily taught a class with an average attendance of five students: 

{{% fig "1907-12-31-bcc-sunday-school" "500" /%}}

[Gertrude Conant](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/162726499/gertrude-l-conant) (19 Jul 1924 to 04 Sep 2007) mentions that Emily played the piano or organ in the Church. The church historical records, as one would naturally expect, cover topics unevenly over the years. Concerning the piano/organ: there was an organ in the church at one time, but it was destroyed by mice. The roles of pianist/organist and that of assistant pianist/organist, were for a time at least, positions that were voted on at the annual meetings just as officers such as secretary and treasurer were. I have not found any references for Emily being in either of those roles, but there are many years where these roles are not noted at all, so unless Gertrude is mis-remembering, without her noting this detail, it would be lost. (Anna Mulks and Cassie Landon were several times noted in these roles.) I will also point out, however, that in the many newspaper accounts and meeting minutes of the {{% pagelink "good-templars" "Good Templars" %}}, there are many mentions of Emily providing literary items for the "Good of the Order", but I don't see any mentions of her providing musical entertainment, which was also a weekly occurrence at their meetings. The Good Templars Lodge, which met above Mills' Store, was known to have an organ.

<figure class="quote-only">
<blockquote> 
Originally a pipe organ stood on a raised platform (for choir) at the back of the auditorium. After it deteriorated (with assistance from the church mice) a piano was used. During the pastorate of Rev. James L. Burckes (1949-1955) the platform was eliminated and double entrance doors cut in the curving wall. Prior to that time there had been only a single entrance door at each side of the wall.

Annual meetings were typically held the first Monday in January, in the afternoon or evening. A small group attended and Emily is not listed as attending these meetings, despite being elected as Treasurer and being acknowledged as filling that role for at least two years:

Emily continued to be involved in temperance into the 1900's, and for some period of time, she was a member of the Women's Christian Temperance Union, along with her step-mother Hannah. This is almost certainly unknowable now, but I have wondered if Hannah was introduced to Edward through the Emily's involvement with temperance. This may also be how Emily knew Ellen Gould. It is interesting to note that the Brookton chapter of the W.C.T.U. was organized in 1907—the year of Emily Mills' and Jessie (Shurter) Brewer's baptism—and that Jessie is also active in the W.C.T.U.

{{% fig "temperance/1917-wctu-directory-p8" "500" /%}}

Edward died on New Year's day 1908, and Emily made another heartbreaking trip to Evergreen Hill Cemetery in Corfu. If Emily walked the streets of Corfu on that trip, she should would have seen that the building that housed her family's store, as well as her childhood home, were now gone.

Edward died "intestate", without a will, and it wasn't until July 1909 that Emily and Hannah, working with their lawyer Fordyce Cobb, became official legal co-owners of the Mills' home and Mills' store assets. Emily followed her father's example and renamed the store M. E. Mills. When Hannah passed less than a decade later, Emily inherited all assets and property.

Thanks to Gertrude Conant's personal recollections, we have a basic description of Emily's appearance and personality:

<figure class="quote-only">
<blockquote>
<p>Emily Mills was a little woman, with her hair in a bun on top of her head, like Grandma Bacon’s. She was quiet, neat, cheerful and always smiling.</p>

These descriptions of Emily's demeanor are consistent with the personal recollections of a current Brooktondale resident, currently in her 90's who has early childhood memories of Emily and her store in the last years of Emily's life.

Due to the level of detail given to the context of this story, I am choosing to include the entire text and not just Emily's section:

Emily fell and broke her hip while on her way to services at Brooktondale Congregational Church on 10 Oct 1937. She spent the last several weeks of her life in Memorial Hospital in Ithaca where she died on 03 November, a few weeks shy of 79 years old. Presumably, she was the first in her family not to die at home (with the possible exception of Horace). Like her father, Emily died without a will.

This moving tribute was authored by E. D. Shurter, a Brookton native who was at different times, an attorney, a college professor and a nationally renowned orator and author. This is Emily's only known obituary and is referenced elsewhere as such:

{{% fig "1937-11-11-ithaca-journal" "500" /%}}

The professor clearly took great care in crafting this tribute, and with the pacing of the final sentence, one can sense the weight of responsibility he felt representing the sense of loss of an entire community who held Emily in equally high esteem. He is Emily's first and most eloquent biographer, without whom we wouldn't fully appreciate some of the most important aspects of Emily's life, most notably, her charitable acts.

The news clippings above give examples, such as her contributions to the Red Cross, and of course, the W.C.T.U. did considerable charitable work. In the M. E. Mills store sales journals, there are entries indicating direct donations from the store that Emily counted against her own account as "Goods for Charity":

There are also entries in the historical records of Caroline Valley Federated Church of extra donations made to the church by both Hannah and Emily among other members. By agreement with the Church, I have not reproduced any financial records here.

Emily was the last in the line of Edward H. Mills, and it seems that her family's story has become unknown to the Mills of subsequent generations. 

[Emily](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/160363879/mary-emily-mills) is interred at Brookton (formerly Quick) Cemetery at the corner of Landon Road and Lounsbery Road in Brooktondale NY, 14817.

As one is standing in front of the Emily's headstone, with back to the cemetery entrance on Lounsbery Road, the ground is disturbed on the left side of the two plots purchased for Emily, indicating where she rests. As is the case with Hannah, the date of birth on Emily's headstone is incorrect:

{{% fig "adams-photos/grave-emily/feature" "800" /%}}

As already shown above, Emily was baptized at the Reformed Dutch Church on Staten Island on 30 Nov 1859, and Emily is listed with her family in the 1860 Federal Census:

{{% fig "census/census-1860-us" "800" /%}}

Furthermore, in her entry in the 1900 US census, Emily indicates her birth date is "Dec 1858". The census data I have seen is presently limited to what is available online through ancestry.com, but among those I was able to find during Emily's lifetime, only the 1900 census asked for month and year of birth, while all others, including 1900, simply ask for age at last birthday. Census' were typically done in May or June of the appropriate years, and Emily's self reported age in each census consistently resolves to 1858 as indicated in the "Computed birthyear" column in the census data summary shown above. 

{{% fig "census/census-1900-us-inset" "800" /%}}

I have been in contact with two people at Brookton Cemetery who have both looked into the matter, and they each confirmed that the only information they have on Emily is the name and plot number "and what is on the headstone". There is no indication who made the funeral arrangements for Emily, who the plot was sold to, or any information that might shed light on the erroneous birth year. Emily's grave stone is the only documentation I have with this birth year other than subsequent histories that were written using the grave stone as the source for her birth year. 

That the birth year on Emily's grave is incorrect suggests Emily's final arrangements were made by one or more people in Brooktondale, likely someone from the Congregational Church, Jessie Brewer being the most likely candidate, although E. D. Shurter is another possibility. This further implies that Emily no longer had contact with any Mills family descendants on Long Island, which seems to be supported by the potential heirs sought out after her death as noted in the [Mills' home]({{% relref "other-past-owners" %}}) deeds.

Further research will obviously need to be done, but ultimately, Emily's exact date of birth (and that of her brothers) may be lost, as she was born during a notoriously bad period for the recording and preservation of birth records. In addition to the usual sources, I submitted a reference question to the staff of the Presbyterian Historical Society, but they were unable to find records for Mary Ann or her children. (Much of the Church's digitized records are actually available via ancestry.com, and in fact, entries can be round for Edward's sister Emily Tabitha Mills for example.) I have also submitted requests to the New York State Department of Health vital records as well as the New York City Department of Records and Information Services, and in both cases so records for Emily's birth were found. It is interesting to note however that according to [ldsgenealogy.com](https://ldsgenealogy.com/NY/Staten-Island-Birth-Records.htm), there are potentially many microfilm records for Richmond County (Staten Island) during this time period.


## Other Historical Accounts

Understandably, previous historical references to the Mills family have typically focused on Emily and her store. All previous secondary sources of information on Emily accepted 1861 as her birth year, which I have presented overwhelming documentary evidence disproving.

Shortly after I moved into the Mills' home in Brooktondale, Molly Adams visited me to sign me up for the Old Mill newsletter, and to give me the following history of Emily Mills and her store. I have since been told that this was a ritual Molly performed with other Brooktondale newcomers. Despite its title, this exceptional account is more about the M. E. Mills store than it is about Emily herself. 

{{% fig "a-note-on-emily-mills" "800" /%}}

Although I read this "Note" with some interest initially, I didn't appreciate its importance until several years too late to ask Molly to teach me more. I at least had the foresight to save it somewhere I could find it again years later when I needed it. I revisit this often, still mining it for clues about Emily, trying to learn what Molly knew. 

The answer to Molly's question "and some groceries?" seems to be yes. Perhaps the question arose because Jessie Brewer apparently did not continue to sell groceries, and this was what residents of the time would more likely remember.

The Caroline History Room in Slaterville Springs NY has a collection of Molly Adams' research notes in file folders, organized by people and property among other subjects. She had a folder of deed research into 475 Brooktondale Road, a folder dedicated to the Mills family, and there are a few drafts of her "Note" that all seem to be dated in the Spring of 2002. Although these versions largely repeat what is in the "Note" and elsewhere, they contain further historical context and most importantly, indicate the sources of the quotes in the "Note" as well as the fact that the "leatherette booklet" was accessioned by the Caroline History Room.

The following appears to be written for publication, or possibly mailed to people to ask them for more information, which was also one of my main motivations for starting the memills.com website. Note that that item is numbered “7”, but I don’t know where this page might have originally come from.

{{% fig "me-mills/2002-apr-molly-adams-note" "800" /%}}

Barbara Kone and others have searched the Caroline History Room for the “leatherette booklet” Molly mentioned, but it has not yet been found. Fortunately, Molly had the foresight to keep printed reproductions in her file folders:

{{% fig "me-mills/me-mills-1-improved" "800" /%}}
{{% fig "me-mills/me-mills-2-improved" "800" /%}}

And Molly retained a printed reproduction of the following item; the location of the original is currently unknown to me:

Emily is also mentioned twice by Molly Adams (1936 to 23 Jun 2014) in her chapter "Town of Caroline" in *The Towns of Tompkins County: From Podunk to the Magnetic Springs* edited by Jane Marsh Dieckmann:

As indicated elsewhere, George Jansen predeceased Emily by two years. The entry that Molly must have been referring to is the mention of Edward's death:

{{% fig "george-jansen-ehmills-entry" "500" "img,cite" /%}}

Emily is mentioned in Town of Caroline Historian Barbara Kone's compilation "A History of the Town of Caroline, Tompkins County, New York, United States of America" known to us all as "The Bicentennial Book."

"A Drive-by Tour of the Town of Caroline" sponsored by the Town of Caroline Bicentennial Committee 1994-1995 contains a listing for M. E. Mills on a page identified as "Tour 4 - P7" in a 2016 reprint by The White Church Cabin Country Store and is the source (with some alterations) of the description Molly Adams used in her "Note". In Molly's research notes, she gives the attribution: "[Driveby, ie Conant]" and I confirmed with Barbara Kone that Gertrude wrote the Brooktondale portions of the "Drive-by" book:

She also had kerosene, Kerosene lamps with green shades, penny candy, stockings, handkerchiefs, yard goods, pins & sewing notions sheets & pillowcases, groceries, etc. She was a "sweet little lady" who succeeded her father in the business. Jessie Brewer had dry goods here after Miss Mills, and also had a lending library in the back.

Gertrude Conant's personal recollections provide valuable details, including physical descriptions of Emily and her store as well as reflections on her personality. If not for Gertrude, these precious details would be long forgotten.

Emily is not mentioned by name, but is implicitly referenced in a photo caption of a portrait of Jessie Brewer published in 2016, "Around Caroline" by Patricia A. Brhel, p23:

> Jesse Brewer ran a dry goods store in Brooktondale, selling fabric, ribbon, greeting cards, and other items. She took over from a woman who had managed a grocery store in the same building and used the proceeds from the store to increase the family income and help support her widowed mother. She was also active in the Caroline Valley Federated (now Community) Church.

*M. E. Mills* is listed as a "present merchant" in the Ithaca Daily Journal, 26 Aug 1909, p5, in an article "Early History of Brookton Village".


## Notes for Future Researchers

Unfortunately, Emily's death certificate does little to clarify her birthdate:

{{% fig "emily-mills-death-certificate" "500" /%}}

One of my main goals is to find photos of the family and their stores, but my highest priority is Emily. No known photos of the family exist. I know of only one person still living who interacted with Emily, and that person says their memory would not be good enough to identify Emily in a photo. 

In Gertrude Conant's recollections, she notes that Ellen Gould "looked a great deal like Miss Mills," so when looking for photos of either woman, one must be cautious not to mis-identify one for the other.

There is an intriguing photo in "Around Caroline" by Patricia A. Brhel that shows a woman minding a general store, with no indication which general store in Caroline it is:

{{% fig "emily/around-caroline-p85" "800" /%}}

In the Caroline History Room in Slaterville Springs NY, a version of this photograph exists as a slide, with the words "CAROLINE DEPOT" written on the back of the slide, identifying the store. A mirror image of those words is visible in the following, in the area of the large window above the door: 

{{% fig "emily/caroline-depot-store" "800" /%}}

I believe that the reference to "Bertha Mills" in the 1914 American Agriculturist Farm Directory shown below is in fact a misprinted reference to Emily. I have yet found no evidence of a Bertha Mills in Brookton at that time, and everything but the reference to the road on the map in that volume fits Emily. As for the map reference, consider that the same road reference is given for Dr. Lockwood and Frank Mulks, Emily's neighbors on what is now Brooktondale Road, and who are listed on the same page:

{{% fig "emily/yatesschuylertom00oran_0212" "800" /%}}
{{% fig "emily/yatesschuylertom00oran_0449-zoomed" "500" /%}}

So far I have found only the following with the name Bertha in Caroline alive in 1914:

  - [Bertha K. Caveney](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100334891/bertha-k-caveney) (1886 yo 1960), approximately 28 in 1914.
  - [Bertha (Pritz) Ross](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/97218399/bertha-ross) (1876 to 1964), approximately 38 in 1914.
  - [Bertha (Bogardus) Beard](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/98912296/bertha-beard) (1873 to 11 Aug 1944), approximately 41 in 1914.

And Emily is the only Mills in Caroline at that time that I am aware.


<!-- 

My own speculation after reading many of the Ithaca Journal "gossip columns" from Emily's lifetime is that there may be a decent probability that Emily, or someone very close to Emily, was the author of these during a period that included the final years of Hannah's life. The fact that Hannah was written of so much and in such glowing terms, and the tone and subtle phrasing of references to Hannah's life, are very suggestive. 

For example, consider the similarity in wording to the gossip column on 17 Jan 1914, Ithaca Journal: "Mrs. Mills is a remarkable woman..."  and Hannah's obituary, presumably written by Emily, on 27 Feb 1917, Ithaca Journal: "Mrs. Mills was one of Brookton’s oldest and most respected citizens and a remarkable woman." Consider also the similarity in the phrases "...who was for many years a prominent merchant in this village..." in the 31 Dec 1895 Daily News of Batavia and the 24 Nov 1906 Ithaca Daily Journal article that refers to Edward as "...for many years a prominent merchant of Brookton...". (Although other aspects of the 31 Dec 1895 article suggests it was written by someone other than Emily.) Hannah and Edward are in several different instances referred to as 'aged' although that in itself is unremarkable. Consider too the level of detail, in say, the obituary for Mary Ann. 

Typically, the gossip columns had a default headline of the area, in this case "Brookton" or occasionally "Brookton Heights". However, there are times when a bigger headline was added emphasizing one aspect of the column. These have the initial appearance of a typical newspaper article, but upon reading, it becomes clear it is the relevant gossip column for that day, with perhaps a little more detail on the topic mentioned in the headline. This was the case with a few of Hannah's entries.

In an informal discussion on the topic with Barbara Kone, it seems unlikely that "Brookton Heights" was ever a name used in the community. The "Brookton Heights" columns are indeed about the people of Brookton, and Barbara suggested that adding "Heights" was someone's attempt to dress up the name.

These gossip columns, it is my understanding, were written by people local to the areas they were reporting on, and over time, you can sense a shift in style, level of detail, who is reported on, etc. that suggest periodic changes in authorship. Brookton was not an enormous community, so it isn't highly improbable that Emily could have been the author for a period. Emily spent all day, every day at the center of the community, within one of its active hubs, and was well placed to observe people's activities.

Further, consider these:

  - Emily was "Superintendent of Literature and Publications" for the W.C.T.U. Why that position?
  - Consider how the store and church are mentioned, perhaps most notably, in the column where the glasses were left at the Congregational Church, and could be retrieved at M. E. Mills.


  - The meeting minutes of the Good Templars that she recorded.
  - Presumably she wrote Hannah's obituary.

Very rarely were authors acknowledged for the gossip columns. In an informal discussion about the gossip columns with Donna Eschenbrenner, it sounds like that The Ithaca Journal significantly downsized in the recent past, some of their records were sent to their parent company in Binghamton, while the rest were simply discarded, so it is very unlikely that any record of who the various "gossip column" authors were still exists.  I have tried to contact the Ithaca Journal to follow up on possible records but have not been able to get a response back.

Finally, I should point out the obvious role that Jessie Brewer played in preserving at least some of the information available here. She appears to have purchased all of Emily's personal and real property at auction, and so apparently, she is the first link the chain of custody for many of the surviving artifacts. 

Consider for example that the 1917 W.C.T.U. Directory at the Tompkins County History Center is one of several dozen in the collection, yet it stands out as all of the others are from many years later. Isn't it curious that to my knowledge, this is the only documentation proving that Emily had been a member of the Union? (Although the gossip columns covering Hanna and Ellen strongly suggest she was, as one would expect her to be anyway.) I made note of the accession information from the Tompkins County History Center but there was no obvious connection to Emily or Jessie, but I suspect that this could have originally been in Emily's and then Jessie's possession.

As for the Good Templars meeting notebook, according to Donna Eschenbrenner "Unfortunately we don't have an accession number on that ledger, so we don't know the donor." But again, I believe this was a possession of Emily's for many decades. She was the secretary for the final entry in the notebook, and the related items, forms, correspondences, etc., are all in Emily's hand, very strongly indicating that she was the last active member of the Templars to possess the notebook. 

The final entry on 27 Aug 1886 seems routine, and there is no indication that the group was disbanding. The fact that there are correspondences and forms along with the notebooks could be an indication of unfinished work in progress, but of course all of this assumes that the letters and correspondences were together and not donated independently. But I believe that based on what exists, a compelling case can be made that at least some of these items were in Emily's possession for many decades. 

Assuming that Emily had these items in her possession when she died then it logically follows that Jessie Brewer had the next hand in preserving these items. And if this argument holds, then this may give us insight into the depth of their relationship, intertwined over many years. I suggest that once Jessie had purchased all of Emily's property, she must have been deeply moved to see Emily's distinctive handwriting and so, she made a point of saving these items. And of course, having purchased Emily's store, Jessie Brewer was initially responsible for preserving the sales journals of M. E. Mills, and perhaps when they were finally removed from the basement, they were still in the place that Jessie had put them years before. This may also explain why the only books known to be preserved are those following Edward's death, when Emily took his place.
