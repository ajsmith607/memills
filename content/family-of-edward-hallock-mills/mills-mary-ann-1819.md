Mary Ann is descended from Captain John Seaman, the American progenitor of the Long Island Seaman families and one of the original settlers of Hempstead. The Seaman family history is summarized in 1928, [The Seaman family in America as descended from Captain John Seaman of Hempstead, Long Island](https://archive.org/details/seamanfamilyinam00seam/page/n15/mode/2up) by Mary Thomas Seaman, archive.org.

Mary Ann married Edward Hallock Mills, then of Castleton Staten Island, on 29 Dec 1850:

All of the Mills children were born in [Staten Island]({{% relref "staten-island" %}}). Mary Ann's son [James Wheelock]({{% relref "mills-james-wheelock" %}}) died sometime between his baptism at the Reformed Dutch Church of Port Richmond, 31 Jul 1857 and before the United States Federal Census recorded 19 Jun 1860, when the family, including all of the Mills' children except James, was living with Bartlett Brown in a home adjoining a store Bartlett had recently purchased. 

Mary Ann's mother Rhoda died 26 Sep 1859, and on 31 Aug 1860, Mary Ann's sister Jerusha died. 

The family arrived in [Corfu NY]({{% relref "corfu" %}}) sometime between 01 Sept 1862 and 01 May 1863, where  Edward opened a new general store E. H. Mills & Co. and Mary Ann became a member of the Presbyterian Church of Corfu.

[Horace]({{% relref "mills-horace-f-1854" %}}) killed himself in Corfu in Oct 1876.

On 05 May 1877, Mary Ann's sister Abigail S. (Pine) Higbie died.

In Mar 1879, the family moved again, this time to Motts Corners, one of several earlier names for Brooktondale, where Edward restarted his grocery and dry goods business on his own as [E. H. Mills]({{% relref "me-mills" %}}). Both [Jonas]({{% relref "mills-jonas-e-1852" %}}) and [Emily]({{% relref "mills-mary-emily-1858" %}}) clerked for their father. 

Mary Ann joins what was then known as the Congregational Church of Motts Corners, presently Caroline Valley Community Church. In my review of the Congregational Church's membership rolls over the years, I have seen a number of instances in which members were officially added to church rolls many months after they had already been documented participating in church meetings, such as was the case with Lydia Forbes Robinson, who officially joined 10 Sep 1911 by letter from Tyrone Presbyterian Church in Weston NY, although she was living in Brookton and participating in church meetings with her husband and former Brookton pastor of the Congregational Church Reverend James Richards Robinson in 1910. So, perhaps Mary Ann was attending the church for some time prior to becoming an official member.
