## The Early Years of High Bridge Lodge No. 296, Mott's Corners

High Bridge Lodge No. 296 of the Independent Order of Good Templars (I.O.G.T., IOGT) was instituted on 06 Mar 1876 at Mott's Corners. At the very beginning, the Lodge met on Mondays, but by their third anniversary supper until their last meeting as No. 296, 27 Aug 1886, they met on Friday evenings at Lounsbery Hall, the second floor over Mills' store, at present day 484 Brooktondale Road, often called "The Old Post Office" by current residents.

The Hall was named for its owners, Edward and Amanda Lounsbery, themselves members of the High Bridge Lodge, who purchased the Mills' store property on 12 Oct 1874, from Amanda's brother, George E. Sanders, himself a "brother" in the Lodge. Interestingly, although it is clearly George **E**. Sanders listed on the store deeds (along with wife Fannie as seller, see Caroline Deeds 1, 556 and Caroline Deeds 3, 234) he appears in the 1870 federal census as “clerk in store” and in the 1875 state census as "tanner", presumably working with Edward Lounsbery, whereas George’s father George **T.** Sanders is listed as a “dealer in dry goods & groceries (ret) in 1870 and simply "merchant" in 1875, suggesting that George Senior managed the store in the building that George Junior owned and where he worked for his father.

Lounsbery Hall was a popular event venue and community space for years.

The temperance movement in Tompkins County appeared to explode in growth between 1875 and 1880 as a result of the activities of the Good Templars in particular, and at the end of that period, the Good Templars would boast over 1000 members county-wide. Several other temperance organizations were strongly represented in the county, and Caroline specifically, at that time including the Royal Templars of Temperance, the Sons of Temperance, and eventually, the Women's Christian Temperance Union.

In the Summer and Fall of 1877, temperance leader Francis Murphy was active in NY, including a number of events in Tompkins County. In many villages, including Mott's Corners, there were a number of "Murphy Meetings" held. 

<figure>

> Francis Murphy (24 April 1836 – 30 June 1907) was an American temperance evangelist. ...Murphy was born in Tagoat, County Wexford, Ireland on 24 April 1836. He immigrated to the U.S. when he was 16 years old. He served in the Federal army during the Civil War. Beginning in 1870 at Portsmouth, N. H., he started temperance reform clubs throughout that state and was their first president. His headquarters were in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and after his first address there in 1876, 65,000 people signed the pledge he wrote: "With malice toward none, with charity for all, I hereby pledge my sacred honor that, God helping me, I will abstain from the use of all intoxicating liquors as a beverage, and that I will encourage others to abstain." This is where he adopted the blue ribbon badge, inspired by a line from The Bible. He labored also in Britain and was a chaplain in the Spanish–American War. In 1900, he went to Honolulu and held a series of meetings. From there he went to Australia, where he obtained a great many more signatures. In 1901 he returned to California to tour there and then established himself in Los Angeles, where he lived the rest of his life. During the course of his temperance labors in America and abroad, Murphy is said to have induced 16 million to sign the pledge.

During this period, Caroline lost one of its strongest temperance leaders, [Josiah Shurter](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100594864/josiah-shurter) (26 Apr 1815 to 05 Aug 1877), a former owner of the Mills' Store property, and the grandfather of Jessie Brewer, who was born four years after Josiah died. Josiah was a "worthy brother" in the Mott's Corners Division of the Sons of Temperance, which was contemporary with the Good Templars, and shortly after his death, Josiah’s widow [Jane (Shutt) Shurter](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100594934/jane-shurter) (21 Nov 1825 to 23 Jun 1897) joined High Bridge Lodge.

> The Ithaca Piano & Organ Company was established in 1877 by William Bostwick and Henry Wegman as successors to The Swiss Organ Company.  The firm was first listed as the “Ithaca Organ Company” and was a division of the “Ithaca Calendar Clock Company”, makers of clocks and other small mechanical devices.  Alonzo Cornell, son of Ezra Cornell (founder of Cornell University) was principal financial backer of the firm.
>
> The Ithaca Piano & Organ Company built a limited number of very elaborately styled parlor organs and lavishly carved upright and square pianos.  Instruments by the Ithaca Piano & Organ Company were of very good quality and are quite rare today.  The Ithaca Piano & Organ Company went out of business in 1885.

> *The Colleen Bawn*, or *The Brides of Garryowen* is a melodramatic play written by Irish playwright Dion Boucicault. It was first performed at Laura Keene's Theatre, New York, on 27 March 1860 with Laura Keene playing Anne Chute and Boucicault playing Myles na Coppaleen. ...*The Colleen Bawn* captivated audiences with its interwoven character plots and overall story.

   - From [Wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Keene): "Laura Keene (20 July 1826 – 4 November 1873) was a British stage actress and theatre manager. In her twenty-year career, she became known as the first powerful female manager in New York. She is most famous for being the lead actress in the play *Our American Cousin*, which was attended by President Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theater in Washington on the evening of his assassination. ...In 1858, *Our American Cousin* debuted in Laura Keene's Theater. On the night of 14 April 1865, Keene's company, which primarily included John Dyott and Harry Hawk, were performing Our American Cousin at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. In attendance that night were President Abraham Lincoln and his wife First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln. Actor John Wilkes Booth fatally shot President Lincoln while Lincoln watched the play from the presidential box; Booth then fled the theatre. Amid the confusion, Keene made her way to the presidential box where Lincoln lay dying and cradled the mortally wounded President's head in her lap. President Lincoln's fatal head wound bled on her dress, staining her cuff. The cuff was later donated to the National Museum of American History."

<figure>

> Dr. Martin Besemer was born in Dryden on the 14th of July, 1848. He has always been a very busy man, and has not devoted time to investigate his family tree as thoroughly as might be; he considers his ancestors as valuable, only that from them he has a heredity of the medical "diathesis." His mother was Joannah Hutchinson, youngest daughter of Dr. Silas Hutchinson, one of the earliest settlers and earliest physicians in the county. Somewhere are yet preserved the antiquated saddle bags and poisonous mixtures of the "old fashioned" doctor, which he carried on his horseback trips; often going beyond Owego on one hand, and to Aurora and even to Auburn on the other. Dr. Silas's father was Dr. James Hutchinson, whose name is among the fifty subscribers to Cullen's "Practice," printed in 1781. On the other side Dr. Besemer starts his genealogy, like all good Americans, from the first settlers in this country. This was J. J. Besemer, a tanner from Central Germany, who settled about 1765 in Albany. Like all good emigrants he reared a large family and died. His son, John Besemer, married a Miss Van Steemburgh, who lived at the time of the Revolution in the one house in Kingston that was not leveled to the ground by the British. Their son, Josiah Besemer, the doctor's father, departed from the shores of the Hudson, and after some wandering came to live on the borders of Dryden and Caroline. 
>
> Dr. Martin Besemer has thus a good heredity toward acquiring the medical art and combines the elements of German industry, Dutch thoughtfulness, and Puritan idealism. His early schooling was at the Ithaca Academy, then a more ambitious institution than now, and with Howard Mead, now Judge Mead, and Will Halsey, now of Halsey Brothers, Chicago, kept bachelor's hall, and graduated in the course of civil engineering. 
> 
> His intentions as to life were yet vague, and the following winter he studied in the Eastman Business College at Poughkeepsie. Meanwhile he had read some medical works, and after leaving Poughkeepsie spent about two years in surveying and in reading mathematics and medicine. In 1867, at the age of twenty, he came to a settled conviction and married, choosing Miss Emma Wolcott, one of the daughters of Squire Wolcott, of Mott's Corners. 
>
> For the five or six years following he devoted his energies to farming and in still further preparing for the study of medicine, which he has always claimed was a hereditary impulse, and could not be gainsaid. In 1873 he entered the Cleveland Homoeopathic Hospital College, and graduated in 1875, being prosecutor and demonstrator of anatomy the last year, and capturing the Sander's obstetric prize. 
> 
> From 1875 to 1885 he was engaged in the practice of medicine in Mott's Corners, now called Brookton, and in 1885 came to Ithaca, where he has since lived. Thus the doctor has been in active practice nineteen years, part of it full of the hardships of a country practice, but latterly a life that is less arduous. Through all the intricacies of a large practice he keeps a cool, mathematical head, always hurried, but still collected, always finding more to do of necessity or charity than he has time for, yet compelling himself to regular hours for everything. 
> 
> In 1891 the doctor was elected to the Board of Censors of the Cleveland Homoeopathic Hospital College, and in 1893 was chosen alumnus trustee of the Cleveland Medical College. He is a member of the Central New York Society and of the American Institute of Homeopathy. 
>
> Dr. Besemer has one son following in his footsteps as nearly as may be. He graduated from Cornell University in 1889, at the age of nineteen; from the New York City University Medical College in 1891 ; from the Cleveland Homoeopathic Medical College in 1892. He is now associated with his father in the practice of medicine, making pathology and microscopic diagnosis a special study and work, with the intention of making a specialty of surgery.

## The Templars' Organizational Structure

This section seeks to provide the reader with adequate context to understand the Lodge meeting minutes.

High Bridge Lodge was what was known in the Order as a "subordinate lodge". Articles V and VI of the Subordinate Lodge Constitution describes offices, terms and duties necessary to understand the meeting minutes.

<figure>

> The regular terms shall commence with the first meetings in February, May, August and November. The officers shall be elected by ballot and majority vote at the last regular meeting of each term, and installed at the first.

</cite>
<figcaption>
</figure>

The following are the offices in the order defined in the Subordinate Lodge Constitution. In practice, the honorific "Worthy" may precede any office title in the meeting minutes, and abbreviations such as W.C. or W.C.T. for the Worthy Chief Templar, were commonly used in the meeting minutes as well as Good Templars publications generally.

<dl>

  1. <dt>Worthy Chief Templar</dt>

     <dd>
     
     "The F. Secretary shall keep just and true accounts between the Lodge and its members, credit the accounts received, and immeidately pay the same over to the Treasurer, taking a receipt." (Chase, *Digest*, p42)

     </dd>
  5. <dt>Treasurer</dt>
     <dd>

     "The Treasurer...shall pay all order drawn on him by the W.C.T., attested by the Secretary, and no others. He shall receive all moneys of the Lodge, and hold the same until experiation of his term, unless otherwise ordered." (Chase, *Digest*, p42)

     </dd>
  6. <dt>Chaplain</dt>
  7. <dt>Marshal</dt>
     <dd>

     "The Marshal shall have charge of the regalia and all other property of the Lodge, which is not specifically entrusted to other officers, and see that it is kept in proper order... He Shall assist the W.C.T. in preserving order, superintend the balloting, count the votes upon division, introduce candidates,and perform such other duties as may be required by the Ritual or Lodge." (Chase, *Digest*, p43)

     </dd>
  8. <dt>Guard, or "Inside Guard"</dt>
     <dd>

     "The Guard and Sentinel, under direction of the W.V.T., shall have charge fo the doors and the anterooms of the Lodge." (Chase, *Digest*, p43)

</figure>

The Secretary, Financial Secretary and Treasurer all had the additional responsibilities of making reports to the Lodge at the end or their (quarterly) terms. 

An additional office was the **P.W.C.T., the Past Worthy Chief Templar**:

<figure>

> The W.C.T of one term shall be, when present, the acting P.W.C.T of the succeeding term. In his absence, the P.W.C.T. next in seniority shall fill that office. He shall have an oversight of the ceremonies, correct errors in the signs and instructions, give the charge to initiates as required by the Ritual, and examine and introduce visitor who apply for admission.

</cite>
<figcaption>
</figure>

Subordinate lodges also had the title of Lodge Deputy which was an annual position position appointed by the W.C.T. with input from other Lodge members. Although Chase's *Digest* references this position in many of its documented decisions, I cannot seem to find an actual description of the duties of this position in the lodge constitutions. Other guides and commentaries more explicitly describes it. [TODO: add lodge deputy description]

High Bridge Lodge also had two standing committees: the finance and sick committees. [TODO: add prescribed standing committees, responsibilities of sick committee.]

At the county level, there was the County Lodge (a "District Lodge" in the more formal terminology of the Good Templars) which held quarterly meetings that was attended by appointed delegates from High Bridge Lodge. Subordinate lodges reported membership numbers to the County Lodge quarterly, as evidenced by the surviving form for High Bridge Lodge, shown elsewhere in this material. 

At the state level, the Grand Lodge held annual meetings of delegates from subordinate lodges across the state. Officers of the Grand Lodge had the additional honorific "Grand" in their titles, for example, Grand Secretary and Grand Worthy Chief Templar, the highest state officer in the Order. 

Similarly at the national level, The Right Worthy Grand Lodge met annually and was "the source of the true and legitimate Order of Good Templars in North America, and possesses such powers and jurisdiction over the whole Order" (Digest, p11.) Somewhat confusingly, the Right Worthy Grand Lodge is sometimes referred to simply as The Grand Lodge of North America or even just "Grand Lodge" when the context implies the national organization. Titles of officers at the national level begin "Right Worthy Grand..." and the highest officer was the Right Worthy Grand Templar, dropping "Chief".

**"Something or Nothing"** furnished by Emily Mills. Part of the difficulty searching for this, is that the phrase "something for nothing" and similar variations were commonly used in advertisements, and more metaphorically in discussions involving political compromise, for example. The phrase "something or nothing" was more often used in moral and philosophical contexts, for example, relating to principles or customs, that they must mean "something or nothing": in other words, if that something did not apply in the given context, it would not apply in any context. 

In addition to searching directly for the title, I looked up specific authors of the time, especially female authors associated with temperance and suffrage, and I reviewed their works specifically. (See the reference section of these material for a list of some of their names.) This approach turned up a possible match (if we assume the Lodge secretary Arthur Green didn't perfectly record the title spoken): the poem "Nothing and Something" by Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, first published in 1872, the subject of which is "the victim of drink".

NOTHING AND SOMETHING. 

It is nothing to me, the beauty said, 
With a careless toss of her pretty head; 
The man is weak if he can’t refrain 
From the cup you say is fraught with pain. 
It was something to her in after years, 
When her eyes were drenched with burning tears, 
And she watched in lonely grief and dread, 
And startled to hear a staggering tread. 

It is nothing to me, the mother said; 
I have no fear that my boy will tread 
In the downward path of sin and shame, 
And crush my heart and darken his name. 
It was something to her when that only son 
From the path of right was early won, 
And madly cast in the flowing bowl 
A ruined body and sin-wrecked soul. 

It is nothing to me, the young man cried: 
In his eye was a flash of scorn and pride; 
I heed not the dreadful things ye tell: 
I can rule myself I know full well. 
It was something to him when in prison he lay 
The victim of drink, life ebbing away; 
And thought of his wretched child and wife, 
And the mournful wreck of his wasted life. 

It is nothing to me, the merchant said, 
As over his ledger he bent his head; 
I’m busy to-day with tare and tret, 
And I have no time to fume and fret. 
It was something to him when over the wire 
A message came from a funeral pyre— 
A drunken conductor had wrecked a train, 
And his wife and child were among the slain. 

It is nothing to me, the voter said, 
The party’s loss is my greatest dread ; 
Then gave his vote for the liquor trade, 
Though hearts were crushed and drunkards made. 
It was something to him in after life, 
When his daughter became a drunkard’s wife 
And her hungry children cried for bread, 
And trembled to hear their father’s tread. 

Is it nothing for us to idly sleep . 
While the cohorts of death their vigils keep? 
To gather the young and thoughtless in, 
And grind in our midst a grist of sin?
It is something, yes, all, for us to stand 
Clasping by faith our Saviour’s hand; 
To learn to labor, live and fight 
On the side of God and changeless light.

  - "Frances Ellen Watkins Harper (September 24, 1825 – February 22, 1911) was an American abolitionist, suffragist, poet, temperance activist, teacher, public speaker, and writer. Beginning in 1845, she was one of the first African American women to be published in the United States. Born free in Baltimore, Maryland, Harper had a long and prolific career, publishing her first book of poetry at the age of 20. At 67, she published her widely praised novel Iola Leroy (1892), placing her among the first Black women to publish a novel. As a young woman in 1850, Harper taught domestic science at Union Seminary in Columbus, Ohio, a school affiliated with the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME). In 1851, while living with the family of William Still, a clerk at the Pennsylvania Abolition Society who helped refugee slaves make their way along the Underground Railroad, Harper started to write anti-slavery literature. After joining the American Anti-Slavery Society in 1853, Harper began her career as a public speaker and political activist. Harper also had a successful literary career. Her collection Poems on Miscellaneous Subjects (1854) was a commercial success, making her the most popular African American poet before Paul Laurence Dunbar. Her short story "Two Offers" was published in the Anglo-African in 1859, making literary history as the first short story published by a Black woman. Harper founded, supported, and held high office in several national progressive organizations. In 1886, she became superintendent of the Colored Section of the Philadelphia and Pennsylvania Women's Christian Temperance Union. In 1896 she helped found the National Association of Colored Women and served as its vice president. Harper died at age 85 on February 22, 1911." ([Frances Ellen Watkins Harper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Ellen_Watkins_Harper), Wikipedia.org) 

  - Although I transcribed this from the 1891 edition, multiple sources corroborate that the first edition of *Sketches of Southern Life* containing this poem was published in 1872, suggesting the possibility that Emily Mills was first introduced to the author as a school student in Corfu NY.

Henry Krum was Caroline Town Supervisor in 1851. "H.S. Krum slipped on an icy pavement in Ithaca last Thursday and broke the small bone in his ankle. Dr. Gallagher reduced the fracture and he is as comfortable as can be under the circumstances." (02 Feb 1889, "Slaterville", Ithaca Daily Journal, Ithaca NY, p3, q23.) Dr. Gallagher was also a Good Templar and is described further below among the list of members.

## Passwords

The Good Templars based their organizational structures and rituals on the model of Freemasonry, including a strict code a secrecy that included the use of passwords.

Updated passwords were issued from Grand Lodges to subordinate lodges like High Bridge, on a quarterly basis. This arrangement served an important practical purpose, as its timing coincided with the payment of dues and was intended to encourage subordinate lodges to be prompt in their payments. Article 4, section 2 of the Constitution of Subordinate Lodges states "no member shall receive the Pass-Word until his dues for the current quarter are paid, and no member without the Pass-Word shall be permitted to sit in the Lodge." (Digest p39-40)



Examples:

  - "Lord save us or we perish" (T&R, p78)

  - 

regalia
digest p25
digest p28, general rules



"The young--that we may save them from falling into the snares of the tempter" (Digest, p28)

According to the Constitution of Subordinate Lodges (High Bridge would be considered a subordinate lodge underneath the Grand Lodge), "No person under twelve years of age shall be admitted a member of this [subordinate] Lodge" (Digest, p38)


"Juvenile Temples" for the youngest members and for older children, "Junior Lodges". "In the Juvenile Temple the children are also taught to abstain from the use of tobacco, as well as to refrain from the practice of gambling and the use of profane language." (Turnbull, p9)



"There are two essential qualifications for membership in the Order: (1) belief in the existence of Almighty God; and (2) willingness to take the Good Templar's life-long pledge.




"20. The P.W. is not be be given unless the member is clear of the books, and to be clear of the books at the commencement of a quarter, one quarter's dues must be paid in advance. -- Iowa, 13, Cal., 8th s., 43. 21. And fines as well as dues. --Ill., 1858." (Digest, p244)

## The Later Members,  Apr 1883 to Aug 1886

Aside from accounting for the presence of the currently elected officers, the meeting minutes did not attempt to provide a complete list of members attending each meeting. Names were noted only in relation to initiations, proposals and motions made, nomination and election of officers and their subsequent attendance, and participation in the Good of the Order. And it is clearly evident from reviewing them that the same subgroups of people tended to routinely hold officer positions and provide items for the Good of the Order, suggesting not only that members in good standing may have had imperfect attendance, but that there were likely  "silent" attendees at meetings, and perhaps Jonas Mills was an example of one of these.

It is also interesting to note that a number of members apparently left and returned, as people like Fred Allen and Arnold Hill are proposed and initiated more than once in the meeting minutes. And recall from the main section on [Temperance]({{% relref "temperance" %}}), that George Richardson was a member of the Good Templars several years before his (re)initiation noted in the meeting minutes above.


### Allen

**Fred E. Allen** is simply listed as a "laborer" in the 1880 U.S. Census. In the 1920 U.S. Federal Census, Fred appears to be working at Brookton Depot and is a boarder at the home of Clarence and Emma (English) Wheeler, across the street from Mills' Home where **Emily Mills** and Ellen Gould were living at the time.

**Will E. "Willie" Allen**, the younger brother of Fred E. Allen, also listed as a "laborer" in the 1880 U.S. Federal Census.

### Auchoomdy

**Edwin "Ed" and "Eddie" Auchmoody** (1867? to 08 Jan 1885) and **[Flora (Auchmoody) Johnson)](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/83627520/flora-johnsona)** (1864, Ithaca NY to 20 Dec 1939, Monrovia CA) are siblings. Ed died during the time of span of the meeting minutes.

"Miss Flora Auchmoody, who spent the winter in Auburn, has returned and is now with Mrs. Hurlburt." (26 Feb 1889, Ithaca Daily Journal, Ithaca NY, p3)

### Ault

**[George W. Ault](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/99698794/george-w-ault)** (1864 to 1899) and **[Myrtle L. "Myrtie" (Ault) Norwood](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100181319/myrtle-a-norwood)** (1868 to 1936) are siblings.

George appears to have worked in the Vandemark Woolen Mill as a "spinner" in 1892 NY State Census, and brother Freeman Ault is "wool carder" The same census lists Myrtie directly below George with the occupation "teacher".

Myrtie married [Jesse A. Norwood](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/182714572/jesse-a-norwood) (1867 to 22 Mar 1953) in Maywood NE. 30 Aug 1894. 

1872-1904, Marriage Records, State Library and Archives, Nebraska State Historical Society, Lincoln NE, ancestry.com 

"Mr. Will Norwood, formerly with Treman, King & Co., Now engaged in real estate at Maywood, Neb., is visiting his Ithaca friends." (02 Feb 1889, Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p3). and elsewhere on the same page,  under the Slaterville column: "Will Norwood of Nebraska is spending a few weeks at his old home here." (Ibid, q21).

(Is Will Norwood "Brother Norwood" from Slaterville that visited High Bridge Lodge on 22 Feb 1884? Major Northwood in Slaterville.)

Jesse, born in Caroline, "at one time operated a restaurant on East Hill. For the past 48 years he has been a fruit grower in Ithaca." (08 Jun 1953, Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p9.) By 1900, they returned to Ithaca, and by 1910, Jesse was operating the East Hill restaurant. 

The couple appears to separate sometime between the 1910 Federal Census and the 1914, when the Ithaca City Directory lists her by herself, indicating she is a widow. The exact nature and circumstances of the separation are unclear to me, but Myrtie kept her married name the rest of her life and often identified herself as a widow, and it appears she lived and worked as a house keeper in various boarding houses.

Myrtie was still living in Ithaca in the 1925 NY State Census, but a few years later, she is listed in the 1927 Fort Myers FL City Directory (p232), and in the 1930 Federal Census for Fort Myers FL, she was also listed as a widow. 

Interestingly, the 1930 Federal Census lists Jesse Norwood living in Precinct 71, Miami-Dade County FL, his status was divorced, he was working as a fruit grove laborer. In 1940, Jesse was still in Dade County, indicating in the Federal Census that he was widowed, and a citrus grove superintendent. He indicates that his highest grade of school completed was eighth.

Census records confirm that Charles commonly went by "Arthur", despite how it may initially appear in the meeting minutes, such as the 15 Jun 1883 entry that initially references "C.A. Denman" and later, "Bro. A. Denman".

[compare 1870 and 1875 with parents information]


In the 15 Jun 1883 meeting, C.A. Denman proposed Miss Ida Olney as a new member of High Bridge Lodge. "Sis Olney" attended her last Lodge meeting on 28 Dec 1883. Arthur and Ida did not attend Lodge the following week on 04 Jan 1884 and married 09 Jan. At the next Lodge meeting of 18 Jan, Arthur returns to the Lodge, for the first time accompanied by "Sis A Denman". 

Arthur's mother is [Maria Catherine "Catherine" (Lounsbery) Denman](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338784/maria_catherine_denman) (01 Sep 1825 to 12 Jan 1893), a daughter of Peter and Harriet Lounsbery, and so, a sister of Edward Lounsbery. She married [Moses Townley Denman](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338783/moses_townley_denman) (28 Dec 1817 to 29 Feb 1892), whose mother Rebecca (Townley) Denman was the sister of Fannie (Townley) Sanders, the grandmother of siblings Amanda Lounsbery, George E. Sanders, and Libbie Peck.

Arthur was a farmer.

### Lounsbery:

  - Charles 
  - Ellen

**[Ellen S. (Tobey) Lounsbery](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100059393/ellen-s-lounsbery)** (08 Aug 1841 to 22 Nov 1921) was, at the time of these meetings, the widow of [Richard Lounsbery](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100059249/richard-lounsbery) (27 Mar 1836 to 27 Jul 1881), one of Edward Lounsbery's brothers.

**[Edward Lounsbery](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338793/edward-lounsbery)** (11 Oct 1833 to 27 Nov 1904) was a veteran of the Civil War, and a tanner and currier whose "tan yard lot" (Deeds) was next to Personius Hall–present day 559 Brooktondale Road–where fellow veteran Walker V. Personius continued "Mott's original store" (Driveby). Edward was a founding member of the David Ireland Post #158 of the GAR in Brookton, which traditionally met outside Personius Hall on Decoration Day to march to Quick Cemetery to decorate the veteran graves. 

{{% fig "mills-home/edward-lounsbery-portrait" "350" /%}}

Edward and wife **[Amanda (Sanders) Lounsbery](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338794/amanda-lounsbery)** (12 Oct 1842 to 13 Nov 1921) were founding members of the Congregational Church of Mott’s Corners, and more examples of Amanda’s handwriting can be found in the Church’s records from her lifetime. The meeting minutes above make it clear that they were among the primary leaders of High Bridge Lodge during that time, and the group typically met in “Lounsbery Hall” above Mills’ Store. During that time and for many years after, the Mills’ Store building was one of a number of properties owned by Edward and Amanda, that would eventually include Mill’s Home, a few years after these meetings. The Lounsbery’s charged $5.00 per quarter rent to the Good Templars for the meeting space. Amanda’s father, George Townley Sanders ran the general store below Lounsbery Hall prior to the Mills move to Mott’s Corners. 

For more information on Edward and Amanda Lounsbery, see their treatment in the sections on [Temperance]({{% relref "temperance" %}}),  [Deeds and Other Past Owners]({{% relref "other-past-owners" %}}) and [Founding the Congregational Church]({{% relref "founding-documents" %}}).   

Amanda’s brother, **George E. Sanders** and his wife, **Fannie (Webster) Sanders**  were also Good Templars and are listed below. George and Amanda's father, [George Townley Sanders](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338795/george-townley-sanders) (14 Nov 1818 to 04 May 1887) is also discussed in the section on [Mills' Store in Brookton NY]({{% relref "me-mills" %}}).

### Mandeville, Theodore

### McWhorter

**[John J. McWhorter](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/99586505/john_j_mcwhorter)** (1857 to ?) was a blacksmith like his father [James McWhorter](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/99584126/james_h_mcwhorter) (Jul 1823 to 1905). (1875 NYS Census). In addition to singing, John played the bass violin in *Dr. Martin Besemer's* "Lodge Band".  In 1882, it is said that he is the leader of the Baptist choir, with sister Charlotte ("Lottie") McWhorter (17 Aug 1882, Ithaca Daily Journal, Ithaca NY, p3, nyshistoricnewspapers.org.), who was also a member of High Bridge Lodge in 1882 (ibid.). Their father James and mother . 

### Mills:

The Good Templars meetings described above occurred during the time that Edward Mills was Brookton Postmaster, and the Brookton Postoffice was housed in his general store, *E.H. Mills*.

**[Jonas Edward Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/75958930/jonas-e-mills )**, born 18 Feb 1852, Staten Island NY, died 13/14 October 1885, Brookton NY. Jonas was the oldest child of Edward Hallock and Mary Ann Mills. The surviving Good Templars meeting minutes overlap the time that Jonas was clerking in his father's general store, and also his final illness and death. For more information, see {{% pagelink "mills-jonas-e-1852" "Jonas' section" %}}.

**[Mary Emily Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/160363879/mary-emily-mills)**, born Dec 1858 Staten Island NY, died 03 Nov 1937 Brooktondale NY, who commonly went by Emily, and in more formal contexts, M. Emily Mills or M. E. Mills. Emily (and perhaps Jonas) joined the Lodge shortly after arriving in Mott’s Corners, as she "furnished entertainment for the good of the order" in August 1879. (20 Aug 1879, Ithaca Daily Journal, Ithaca NY, p4.) She remained with the lodge until its last meeting, where her name, and position as Secretary are the last words recorded for the Lodge. Emily was the youngest child of Edward Hallock and Mary Ann Mills, and she was the last surviving member of Edward Mills' family. At least by 1892, she lists herself as clerk in her father's store in the NY State Census. Emily took over her father's store after his death and ran it as M.E. Mills until her death. Emily was a member of the Congregational Church and was involved in temperance for many decades, also joining the WCTU.

### Shurter:

**[Professor Edwin DuBois "E. D." Shurter](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/99602781/mary_catherine_shurter)**, (24 Oct 1863 to 13 Oct 1946) was born and raised in Mott's Corners, and became a lawyer in Ithaca early in his career before entering academia, eventually becoming the Chair of Oratory at the University of Texas, Austin, and authoring a number of respected books on the subject over several decades. The professor and his wife [Alice (Burtt) Shurter](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100332796/alice_shurter) (26 Dec 1870 to 10 Apr 1951) lived in Austin TX for a number of years, visiting Brookton periodically before finally returning to the hamlet. 

Cornell University library owns several of Edwin and Alice's scrapbooks that cover the time of their courtship through their years in Austin, and documenting their travels. The organization of the books suggests this was a hobby that both independently engaged in prior to their marriage, and then continued together. The scrapbooks include photographs, and the context suggests to me that photography may have been primarily Alice's interest. There are a number of fascinating items in the scrapbooks, including a small sealed envelope containing the Professor's shaved mustache hairs, which Alice documented amusingly.

A partial bibliography of the Professor's publications:

E. D. Shurter also wrote "In Tribute to Emily Mills" in the Ithaca Journal after she died. 

The Professor's middle name is alternately spelled "Dubois" and "Du Bois" among other typographical variations.

**[Jane (Shutt) Shurter](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100594934/jane-shurter)** (21 Nov 1825 to 23 Jun 1897) was the widow of [Josiah Shurter](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100594864/josiah-shurter) (26 Apr 1815 to 05 Aug 1877), a former owner of the Mills' Store property and lower grist mill, and the grandfather of Jessie Brewer, who was born four years after Josiah died. Josiah was a "worthy brother" in the Mott's Corners Division of the Sons of Temperance at the time of his death. Jane joined the Good Templars shortly after his death.

May Tobey was baptized, along with Emily Mills and 13 other people, by Reverend Annis Ford Eastman on 07 Apr 1907. 

See also May Tobey's sister **Ellen S. (Tobey) Lounsbery** above under Lounsbery. At the time of these meetings, Ellen was the widow of Richard Lounsbery, one of Edward Lounsbery's brothers. May Tobey and her brother-in-law Richard Lounsbery performed music together on multiple occasions.

### Wolcott

**[William Benton Wolcott](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100303590/william-benton-wolcott)** (06 Oct 1832 to 25 Feb 1911), was a Civil War Veteran in Company K of the 137th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment under the command of Colonel David Ireland, whose name was later honored by the Brookton post of the GAR. William participated in the battles of Resaca, Chancellorsville and Gettysburg, as was well as the sieges of Altanta and Savanna, among many other battles and campaigns. His regiment "helped raise the Stars and Stripes over Atlanta".

William married [Ellen A. (Shurter) Wolcott Aldrich](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/187990128/ellen-a-aldrich_wolcott) (07 Sep 1843 to 21 Apr 1928), in 30 Aug 1862, just weeks before William mustered in at Binghamton NY on 25 Sep 1862. Immediately after mustering out on 09 Jun 1865, William and Ellen are recorded in the NY census living with Ellen's father Josiah Shurter at The Shurter House. 

A few years later, William Wolcott becomes the first owner of 475 Brooktondale Road when it was first subdivided from the lower grist mill owned by Jacob Vandemark and Charles W. Personius. The property at this time was known as "The Wolcott Lot". William Wolcott at various times in the census records gave his occupation as carpenter, wagon maker, and carriage maker. Given his occupation, I speculate that he was the primary builder of the original structure at 475, that survives today as I write these words within its walls. William's father-in-law Josiah Shurter also describes himself as both a "wagon maker" and a "carriage maker", and it seems reasonable to assume that both men worked in "The Brewer Barn" that was known at one time as "Willis Shurter's Wagon Shop in Motts Corners". Willis Shurter inherited his father Josiah Shurter’s businesses, and Willis Shurter was Jesse (Shurter) Brewer’s father.

Esty's father is [Bennett T. Landon](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/63631620/bennett-t-landon) (05 Oct 1829 to 1904) of Danby, and Bennett is the brother of [Sextus Barnes "S.B."

I decided to take another run at figuring out the "credit system contest", and by piecing together small details from a number of different newspaper articles from around the country, I think I have a rough outline of what this was. Thankfully the Good Templars were so aggressive in promoting themselves in the papers!

It seems the contest was typically organized into two teams sometimes referred to as “companies”, “divisions” or simply “sides”. Each side has a captain, , and each team had a captain. In at least one case, the teams were divided by gender, but this seems unlikely to be the norm and was not the case with the High Bridge Lodge contest in 1883. 

Teams earned credits for participating in various temperance related activities, and the context suggests that different activities had different credit scores: on the lower end of the scoring spectrum were activities such as attending weekly lodge meetings, as attested to in the recorded "roll call" done during the contest at High Bridge Lodge. On the higher end, it appears that the most valued activity was recruiting new members.

The "credit systems" advertised in The Official Organ would have included rules for earning credits and forms for tracking credits earned.

At the end of the contest, the losing team furnished "a reward of merit" to the winning team, and this typically involved furnishing a dinner. 

Edward Lounsbery and likely Richard Denman, although Arthur and Charles Hill, are credited with the idea of the credit system contest.      

"Intermission, during which Bro Denman's side furnished ice cream for the company as a reward of merit for the Credit contest." (15 Jun 1883, Meeting Minutes, High Bridge Lodge No. 296, Brookton NY. ) 

The idea of the credit system contest may have originated (or at least been formalized) by the Good Templars and spread to other organizations. The vast majority of the newspaper reporting on these contests were of the Good Templars. I did find several references to what seemed to be similar credit system contests associated with the Grange, and even one associated with a church Sunday school (31 Jan 1918, Morning Press, Santa Barbrar CA, p5, q21, newspapers.com), suggesting to me the possibility that the idea originated with the Good Templars and entered these other organizations through either current, or perhaps more likely, former Good Templars members. 

It would be natural for Good Templars to also be members of the Grange as well as active in their local churches. There were many parallels between the Good Templars and the Grange. They were both secret fraternal orders heavily influenced by the rituals of the Freemasons, the Good Templars organized before the Civil War and the Grange after, . I have found credit system contests mentioned into the 1930's, and most of the Grange references were in the 20th century and seem to coincide with a decline of mentions of such contests among the Good Templars during the same time.  

<figure>

> At a meeting of Banner Lodge, of Good Templars of Southhold, held last Thursday evening, two new members were admitted, William Wooden and Arnold Danz. The judges in the credit system contest, William M. Wood, Mrs. Jessie Wells and E. Ernest Boissian, announced that Company B, Capt. Benjamin S. Conklin, was the winning side, having a majority of two hundred and thirty-two credits. The losing side is to purchase a fine new chair for the use of the Chief Templar. The credit system has proven of great benefit to the lodge. New members have been added, interesting programmes have been given each meeting night, and great interest has been manifested by all of the members.

As we intimated previously this supper will be free–that is free to Good Templars. The intention is to have a grand banquet, strawberries, with all the accessories and et ceteras, lemonade, and cold water, we suppose, and if they succeed in eating up all the victuals which we have been informed will be provided, there’ll be no need of more eating for some time to come."

> When the Grange first began in 1867, it borrowed some of its rituals and symbols from Freemasonry, including oaths, secret meetings, and special passwords necessary to keep railroad spies out of their meetings. It also copied ideas from Greek, Roman and Biblical mythology. Small, ceremonial farm tools are often displayed at Grange meetings. Elected officers are in charge of opening and closing each meeting. There are seven degrees of Grange membership; the ceremony of each degree relates to the seasons and various symbols and principles. During the last few decades, the Grange has moved toward public meetings and no longer meets in secret. Though the secret meetings do not occur, the Grange still acknowledges its rich history and practices some traditions.

(The most fundamental requirement of membership in the Templars was a belief in God, and with the possible exception of Lodges that had formed in India, this was the Christian God. Consider that W. T. Graham, a member at one time of High Bridge Lodge was also associated with the Sunday School of Brookton Congregational Church.)

## After August 1886

Although the Ithaca Union Lodge appeared to be active well into the early 1900's, many lodges that were considered very strong, such as those in Danby, Freeville and Mclean all eventually became inactive and years later, newspaper accounts tell of the local citizens trying to form new lodges of the Good Templars in some of these places.

The following news item is the last mention I have yet found of the existence of the High Bridge Lodge.

{{% fig "temperance/1891-01-22-The-Journal-Ithaca-NY" "500" /%}}


## The Meaning of "High Bridge"

As the 22 Jan 1891 edition of the Ithaca Journal confirms, High Bridge Lodge was named for the wooden trestle at Mott’s Corners, which had just been completed in December 1875, a few months prior to the formation of High Bridge Lodge, 06 March 1876. 

{{% fig "trestle/wooden_trestle" "800" /%}}

> The Utica, Ithaca and Elmira Railroad was later known as Elmira, Cortland and Northern Railroad. In 1905 it was absorbed by the Lehigh Valley Railroad. The tracks came out of Ithaca at East Hill up the north side of Six-Mile Creek valley, crossed Brookton on the trestle, crossed the DL&W tracks at Caroline Junction, and continued on to Willseyville. 
> 
> In 1874 the wooden trestle at Brookton was started, and completed in December 1875. It was made of foot-square timbers cut from area forests and set close together in several tiers 1600 feet long and 85 feet high. It was built for the Utica, Ithaca and Elmira Railroad. "The wooden trestle required a watchman to cross it on foot after each train, just to make sure no fire had started anywhere in its timbers. 
> 
> "As the old trestle weakened, it seemed so frightening that passenger trains stopped at the approach to either end and let fearful passengers walk across if they chose. 
> 
> "In 1894 the wooden structure was replaced by one of steel. The work was done by Moses Hurlbut and his crew was quite remarkable, too, in that traffic was never completely stopped for the replacement. The metal bridge was placed without fully tearing down the old wooden one beforehand. 
> 
> "The crew worked through the week preparing sections of the old trestle for removal and then, on Sunday, when no trains ran, a single span would be cut out and replaced. During the entire rebuilding program, not one train missed its schedule because of the trestle-builders' activities."(Ithaca Journal--Glance Backward by Barbara Bell) 
>
> The steel trestle was about 800 feet long and 85 feet high at its highest point over the valley. It was called "the new bridge" and Lyman Gallagher of Slaterville said that "old valley residents who had lived 50 years in the protection of that gigantic wooden windbreak, practically were blown out of their homesteads when the new steel bridge failed to stop the force of the winds up the valley." 
>
> Lehigh Valley Railroad service was discontinued on 1 July 1935 on the old branch line over the stretch from Van Etten to East Ithaca. The "last" passenger train out of Ithaca to Owego over the 110 year old Cayuga-Susquehanna & Western branch of the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad, was on Palm Sunday and in short order, the trestle was taken down by a small crew of Bethlehem Steel company workmen.

The "Great Iron Bridge at Brookton" in the photograph below replaced the original wooden trestle. A version of this postcard can be found on page 57 in *The Towns of Tompkins County: From Podunk to the Magnetic Springs* edited by Jane Marsh Dieckmann, which states it was taken in 1907, when Edward Mills was still alive.

Note that the photographer is standing on or very near the "brow of the hill" that forms the western boundary of the Mills' Home parcel. I have tried to recreate this photograph to get a more exact idea of where the photographer was standing, but the view is now obscured by trees, making it difficult. However, I think that the photographer was in the general area of the concrete marker on the hill brow as it descends back toward Brooktondale Road, above where the concrete retaining wall is presently. That concrete marker is represented on the survey maps of 475 Brooktondale Road.

The trestle was dismantled in the final years of Emily's life. The trestle was easily visible from both Mills' Store and Mills' Home.

> As automobile and truck traffic increased, train traffic decreased. When the Brooktondale trestle was damaged in the 1935 flood, it was abandoned by the Lehigh Valley Railroad and demolished for scrap. The Brooktondale and Besemer stations closed.

As will be seen, a lodge described as being in a "very flourishing condition" was a common refrain used over the years and in many locations of the Good Templars, whose members were encouraged to advertise their lodges, such as with regular newspaper updates.

> The International Organisation of Good Templars (IOGT; founded as the Independent Order of Good Templars), whose international body is known as Movendi International, is a fraternal organization which is part of the temperance movement, promoting abstinence from alcohol and other drugs. …The IOGT originated as one of a number of fraternal organizations for temperance or total abstinence founded in the 19th century and with a structure modeled on Freemasonry, using similar ritual and regalia. Unlike many, however, it admitted men and women equally, and also made no distinction by race. The IOGT named themselves after the Knights Templar, citing the legend that the original knights "drank sour milk, and also because they were fighting 'a great crusade' against 'this terrible vice' of alcohol."
