The deed history for the "Upper Grist Mill" can be followed back from the current address of 7 Mill Street, Tax ID: 10.-6-8. The land that the mill sat on was appropriated from that parcel by the State of NY on 02 Jul 1965, the rough timeframe of the "practice burn". The historical deeds refer to the Upper Grist Mill as the "Motts Mill Property".

> The building of the early mills at this point determined its locality as a site for a village. The Upper Grist Mill, as it has been known, stands nearly opposite the site of the old Cantine Mill, which was built about the year 1800, and was burned in 1862, while owned by Joseph Chambers. The present mill was built by George White in 1865, and was sold by him to F. C. Cornell. This mill is not now running. It was at one time owned by William Mott 2d, as was also the mill on the present Voorhis site several years previous. The latter mill was destroyed by fire and rebuilt by David C. Roe in 1850. It passed through several hands to the Voorhises, father and sons, and was burnt in 1890 or 91. Fred E. Bates then became proprietor of the site and built thereon the present mill, and very soon after resold it to the Voorhis brothers. Daniel M. White and Fred E. Bates have two saw mills here. "

  - Note that the first part of the quote is referring to the Upper Grist Mill, but the second part, that references "the present Voorhis site" and "the latter mill" is referring to the Lower Grist Mill, the future site of Dalebrook.

Beginning with the oldest deed I have yet found, 01 Dec 1864, Caroline Deeds book 1, page 266, the original parcel was "supposed to contain ten acres of land upon which is situated the grist mill, plaster mill, saw mill, dwelling house, orchard and Blacksmith Shop". This would seem to indicate that the "S & G Mill" noted on the 1866 map of Mott's Corners from the *Photographic Atlas of Tompkins County, New York*, Stone & Stewart, Philadelphia, p21, stands for "saw and grist mill". Later variations of this description add: "hay scales" and "all that concerns of the grist mill of wood, stone, and cast and wrought iron, and the same of the plaster mill".

On 13 Dec 1870 the property was purchased by Franklin Cuthbert Cornell Sr. (28 Aug 1837 to 22 Jan 1908), the eldest son of Ezra Cornell (11 Jan 1807 to 09 Dec 1874), the founder of Cornell University. When Frank C. Cornell sold the property to George Campbell, Caroline Deeds book 3, page 550, 21 May 1881, a "piece of land" is reserved for Edward Lounsbery and George (E.) Sanders, which seems to corroborate a Carl English painting that refers to a tannery near the mill, although the deeds only refer to it as a "factory".

Lounsbery Road was formerly known as Hoffman Road. The section of Valley Road that fronts the upper mill was called Mechanic's Road.

Benjamin F. Hoffman (? to 28 Feb 1866) was married to Susan Maria (Snow) Cantine Hoffman (09 Oct 1819 to 18 Sep 1898) whose first husband was Charles Cantine Jr. (08 May 1814 to 23 Aug 1845) the son of Charles Cantine (23 Sep 1771 to 20 Dec 1831). 

Charles Cantine Jr.'s sister Harriet (Cantine) Lounsbery (06 Nov 1801 to 17 Jul 1880) was married to Peter Lounsbery (12 May 1797 to 04 Apr 1867) on 21 Jun 1824 in Marbletown NY. The earliest deeds provided state that it is "land conveyed by will from Charles Cantine to his daughter Harriet", and Peter Lounsbery's name appears on the deeds in his role as Justice of the Peace. 

Peter and Harriet's large family included Edward Lounsbery (11 Oct 1833 to 27 Nov 1904), the tanner and Civil War Veteran who helped found the Congregational Church of Mott's Corners, the High Bridge Lodge of the International Order of Good Templars, and the David Ireland Post of the GAR.
