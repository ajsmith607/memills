An overview of the temperance group High Bridge Lodge No. 296 of the Independent Order of Good Templars in Brookton NY, including transcriptions of a photographic inventory of entries from a meeting minutes notebook archived at the Tompkins County History Center, Ithaca, NY. As time allows, I will transcribe the entries, proofread, index and identify the members, and provide more complete citations for the literary works mentioned. I will also provide contextual information on the organizational structure and history of High Bridge Lodge and the overall Order, to provide context for better understanding the newspaper accounts and meeting minutes.

## The Early Years of High Bridge Lodge No. 296, Mott's Corners

As the 22 Jan 1891 edition of the Ithaca Journal confirms, High Bridge Lodge was named for the wooden trestle at Mott’s Corners, which had just been completed in December 1875, a few months prior to the formation of High Bridge Lodge on 06 March 1876.

There are perhaps future members of High Bridge Lodge in the photograph above. For more information on the "High Bridge", see {{% pagelink "trestle" %}}.

High Bridge Lodge No. 296 of the Independent Order of Good Templars (I.O.G.T., IOGT) was instituted on 06 Mar 1876 at Mott's Corners. (See the 30 Apr 1886 Quarterly Return form further below, which gives the exact date.) At the very beginning, the Lodge met on Mondays, but by their third anniversary supper until their last meeting as No. 296, 27 Aug 1886, they met on Friday evenings at Lounsbery Hall, the second floor over Mills' Store, at present day 484 Brooktondale Road, often called "The Old Post Office" by current residents. Lounsbery Hall was so named for the building's owners at the time, Edward and Amanda Lounsbery, who were also members of High Bridge Lodge. For more information on Lounsbery Hall, see {{% pagelink "me-mills" %}}.

The temperance movement in Tompkins County appeared to explode in growth between 1875 and 1880 as a result of the activities of the Good Templars in particular, and at the end of that period, High Bridge Lodge would have "about seventy" members, and the Good Templars county-wide would boast over 1000 members. 

By the time Emily Mills joined High Bridge Lodge in Spring 1879, there were four Good Templars Lodges in Caroline alone:

  - Crystal Fountain Lodge No. 234 of Slaterville.
  - High Bridge Lodge No. 296 of Mott's Corners. 
  - Speedsville Lodge No. 353 of Speedsville.
  - Temperance Star, No. 384 of Caroline Center.

{{% fig "temperance/1877-08-27-Ithaca-Daily-Journal-Ithaca-NY-p4b" "500" /%}}

Several other temperance organizations were also strongly represented in the county, and Caroline specifically, at that time including the Royal Templars of Temperance, the Sons of Temperance, and eventually, the Women's Christian Temperance Union. 

The Summer and Fall of 1877 seems to be a particularly exciting time in the movement, as national temperance leader Francis Murphy was active in NY, including participating in a number of events throughout Tompkins County. In many villages, including Mott's Corners, there were a number of "Murphy Meetings" held. 

<figure>

> Francis Murphy (24 April 1836 – 30 June 1907) was an American temperance evangelist. ...Murphy was born in Tagoat, County Wexford, Ireland on 24 April 1836. He immigrated to the U.S. when he was 16 years old. He served in the Federal army during the Civil War. Beginning in 1870 at Portsmouth, N. H., he started temperance reform clubs throughout that state and was their first president. His headquarters were in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and after his first address there in 1876, 65,000 people signed the pledge he wrote: "With malice toward none, with charity for all, I hereby pledge my sacred honor that, God helping me, I will abstain from the use of all intoxicating liquors as a beverage, and that I will encourage others to abstain." This is where he adopted the blue ribbon badge, inspired by a line from The Bible. He labored also in Britain and was a chaplain in the Spanish–American War. In 1900, he went to Honolulu and held a series of meetings. From there he went to Australia, where he obtained a great many more signatures. In 1901 he returned to California to tour there and then established himself in Los Angeles, where he lived the rest of his life. During the course of his temperance labors in America and abroad, Murphy is said to have induced 16 million to sign the pledge.

During this period, Caroline lost one of its strongest temperance leaders, [Josiah Shurter](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100594864/josiah-shurter) (26 Apr 1815 to 05 Aug 1877), a former owner of the Mills' Store property, and the grandfather of Jessie Brewer, who was born four years after Josiah died. Josiah was a "worthy brother" in the Mott's Corners Division of the Sons of Temperance, which was contemporary with the Good Templars, and shortly after his death, Josiah’s widow [Jane (Shutt) Shurter](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100594934/jane-shurter) (21 Nov 1825 to 23 Jun 1897) joined High Bridge Lodge.

The items immediately following offer some insight into the Lodge’s organ. The meeting minutes further below mention that the organ still existed then.

<figure>

> The Ithaca Piano & Organ Company was established in 1877 by William Bostwick and Henry Wegman as successors to The Swiss Organ Company.  The firm was first listed as the “Ithaca Organ Company” and was a division of the “Ithaca Calendar Clock Company”, makers of clocks and other small mechanical devices.  Alonzo Cornell, son of Ezra Cornell (founder of Cornell University) was principal financial backer of the firm.
>
> The Ithaca Piano & Organ Company built a limited number of very elaborately styled parlor organs and lavishly carved upright and square pianos.  Instruments by the Ithaca Piano & Organ Company were of very good quality and are quite rare today.  The Ithaca Piano & Organ Company went out of business in 1885.

As alluded to in the piece immediately above, Emily Mills and George Richardson, along with other Good Templars members, acted in an acclaimed production of the play *The Colleen Bawn*, in which Emily had the supporting role of "Sheelah".

> *The Colleen Bawn*, or *The Brides of Garryowen* is a melodramatic play written by Irish playwright Dion Boucicault. It was first performed at Laura Keene's Theatre, New York, on 27 March 1860 with Laura Keene playing Anne Chute and Boucicault playing Myles na Coppaleen. ...*The Colleen Bawn* captivated audiences with its interwoven character plots and overall story.

   - "Laura Keene (20 July 1826 – 4 November 1873) was a British stage actress and theatre manager. In her twenty-year career, she became known as the first powerful female manager in New York. She is most famous for being the lead actress in the play *Our American Cousin*, which was attended by President Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theater in Washington on the evening of his assassination. ...In 1858, *Our American Cousin* debuted in Laura Keene's Theater. On the night of 14 April 1865, Keene's company, which primarily included John Dyott and Harry Hawk, were performing Our American Cousin at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. In attendance that night were President Abraham Lincoln and his wife First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln. Actor John Wilkes Booth fatally shot President Lincoln while Lincoln watched the play from the presidential box; Booth then fled the theatre. Amid the confusion, Keene made her way to the presidential box where Lincoln lay dying and cradled the mortally wounded President's head in her lap. President Lincoln's fatal head wound bled on her dress, staining her cuff. The cuff was later donated to the National Museum of American History."

### Ault

**F. G. Ault** and **Mrs. F. G. Ault** appear to be [Freeman C. Ault](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/99678565/freeman-c-ault) (1851 to 1930) married [Mary V. Ault](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/99678641/mary_v_ault) (1855 to 1923).


### Besemer

**[Dr. Martin VanBuren Besemer](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/97409239/martin_vanburen_besemer)** (14 Jul 1848 to 03 Dec 1916) married **[Emma (Wolcott) Besemer](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/97409338/emma_besemer)** (1845 to 19 Dec 1917) and was therefore the brother-in-law of **William Benton Wolcott**, another member listed below among the later members, and the original owner of "The Wolcott Lot" that would later be known as "The Mills' Place", 475 Brooktondale Road.

<figure>

> Dr. Martin Besemer was born in Dryden on the 14th of July, 1848. He has always been a very busy man, and has not devoted time to investigate his family tree as thoroughly as might be; he considers his ancestors as valuable, only that from them he has a heredity of the medical "diathesis." His mother was Joannah Hutchinson, youngest daughter of Dr. Silas Hutchinson, one of the earliest settlers and earliest physicians in the county. Somewhere are yet preserved the antiquated saddle bags and poisonous mixtures of the "old fashioned" doctor, which he carried on his horseback trips; often going beyond Owego on one hand, and to Aurora and even to Auburn on the other. Dr. Silas's father was Dr. James Hutchinson, whose name is among the fifty subscribers to Cullen's "Practice," printed in 1781. On the other side Dr. Besemer starts his genealogy, like all good Americans, from the first settlers in this country. This was J. J. Besemer, a tanner from Central Germany, who settled about 1765 in Albany. Like all good emigrants he reared a large family and died. His son, John Besemer, married a Miss Van Steemburgh, who lived at the time of the Revolution in the one house in Kingston that was not leveled to the ground by the British. Their son, Josiah Besemer, the doctor's father, departed from the shores of the Hudson, and after some wandering came to live on the borders of Dryden and Caroline. 
>
> Dr. Martin Besemer has thus a good heredity toward acquiring the medical art and combines the elements of German industry, Dutch thoughtfulness, and Puritan idealism. His early schooling was at the Ithaca Academy, then a more ambitious institution than now, and with Howard Mead, now Judge Mead, and Will Halsey, now of Halsey Brothers, Chicago, kept bachelor's hall, and graduated in the course of civil engineering. 
> 
> His intentions as to life were yet vague, and the following winter he studied in the Eastman Business College at Poughkeepsie. Meanwhile he had read some medical works, and after leaving Poughkeepsie spent about two years in surveying and in reading mathematics and medicine. In 1867, at the age of twenty, he came to a settled conviction and married, choosing Miss Emma Wolcott, one of the daughters of Squire Wolcott, of Mott's Corners. 
>
> For the five or six years following he devoted his energies to farming and in still further preparing for the study of medicine, which he has always claimed was a hereditary impulse, and could not be gainsaid. In 1873 he entered the Cleveland Homoeopathic Hospital College, and graduated in 1875, being prosecutor and demonstrator of anatomy the last year, and capturing the Sander's obstetric prize. 
> 
> From 1875 to 1885 he was engaged in the practice of medicine in Mott's Corners, now called Brookton, and in 1885 came to Ithaca, where he has since lived. Thus the doctor has been in active practice nineteen years, part of it full of the hardships of a country practice, but latterly a life that is less arduous. Through all the intricacies of a large practice he keeps a cool, mathematical head, always hurried, but still collected, always finding more to do of necessity or charity than he has time for, yet compelling himself to regular hours for everything. 
> 
> In 1891 the doctor was elected to the Board of Censors of the Cleveland Homoeopathic Hospital College, and in 1893 was chosen alumnus trustee of the Cleveland Medical College. He is a member of the Central New York Society and of the American Institute of Homeopathy. 
>
> Dr. Besemer has one son following in his footsteps as nearly as may be. He graduated from Cornell University in 1889, at the age of nineteen; from the New York City University Medical College in 1891 ; from the Cleveland Homoeopathic Medical College in 1892. He is now associated with his father in the practice of medicine, making pathology and microscopic diagnosis a special study and work, with the intention of making a specialty of surgery.

### Denman

**[Moses Townley Denman](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338783/moses_townley_denman)** (28 Dec 1817 to 29 Feb 1892), married **[Maria Catherine "Catherine" (Lounsbery) Denman](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338784/maria_catherine_denman)** (01 Sep 1825 to 12 Jan 1893) and among their children are fellow members **[Charles Arthur "Arthur" Denman](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338787/charles-arthur-denman)** (25 Mar 1855 to 21 Apr 1911) and **Richard Lounsbery Denman**. 

Catherine is **Edward Lounsbery's** sister. Moses' mother was Rebecca (Townley) Denman, the sister of Fannie (Townley) Sanders, the grandmother of siblings **Amanda (Sanders) Lounsbery**, **George E. Sanders**, and **Libbie (Sanders) Peck**, all of whom are explored further below.

Census records confirm that Charles Arthur Denman commonly went by "Arthur", despite how it may initially appear in the meeting minutes below, such as the 15 Jun 1883 entry that initially references "C.A. Denman" and later, "Bro. A. Denman". In the newspaper accounts above, he is referenced as "C. Arthur Denman". Arthur was a farmer, and he remained a Templar in the later years of the Lodge, alongside his brother **Richard Lounsbery Denman**.

[Mariah Amelia "Amelia" (Cole) Losey](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100913039/mariah_a_losey) (05 Sep 1846 to 10 Sep 1923) married [Maurice A. "Morris" Losey](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100913024/maurice-a.-losey) (26 Jan 1844 to 22 Feb 1931). When Amelia is mentioned as a member in Nov 1876, Morris is a butcher in Brookton, but by 1880, they are living in Syracuse where Morris works as a gunsmith for several decades. The Losey's remained in Onondaga County for the rest of their lives. 

### Lounsbery

**[Edward Lounsbery](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338793/edward-lounsbery)** (11 Oct 1833 to 27 Nov 1904) was a veteran of the Civil War, and a tanner and currier whose "tan yard lot" (Deeds) was next to Personius Hall–present day 559 Brooktondale Road–where fellow veteran Walker V. Personius continued "Mott's original store" (Driveby). Edward was a founding member of the David Ireland Post #158 of the GAR in Brookton, which traditionally met outside Personius Hall on Decoration Day to march to Quick Cemetery to decorate the veteran graves. 

{{% fig "mills-home/edward-lounsbery-portrait" "350" /%}}

Edward and wife **[Amanda (Sanders) Lounsbery](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338794/amanda-lounsbery)** (12 Oct 1842 to 13 Nov 1921) were founding members of the Congregational Church of Mott’s Corners, and more examples of Amanda’s handwriting can be found in the Church’s records from her lifetime. The meeting minutes above make it clear that they were among the primary leaders of High Bridge Lodge during that time, and the group typically met in “Lounsbery Hall” above Mills’ Store. During that time and for many years after, the Mills’ Store building was one of a number of properties owned by Edward and Amanda, that would eventually include Mill’s Home, a few years after these meetings. The Lounsbery’s charged $5.00 per quarter rent to the Good Templars for the meeting space. Amanda’s father, **George Townley Sanders** ran the general store below Lounsbery Hall prior to the Mills move to Mott’s Corners, and his son **George E. Sanders** owned the building before selling it to Amanda's husband Edward.

For more information on Edward and Amanda Lounsbery, see their treatment in the sections on [Temperance]({{% relref "temperance" %}}),  [Deeds and Other Past Owners]({{% relref "other-past-owners" %}}) and [Founding the Congregational Church]({{% relref "founding-documents" %}}).   

**[Ellen S. (Tobey) Lounsbery](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100059393/ellen-s-lounsbery)** (08 Aug 1841 to 22 Nov 1921) was, at the time of these meetings, the widow of [Richard Lounsbery](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100059249/richard-lounsbery) (27 Mar 1836 to 27 Jul 1881), one of Edward Lounsbery's brothers. Ellen is also the sister of May Tobey, who is discussed further below among the later members of the Lodge.

(1875 NYS Census). In addition to singing, John played the bass violin in *Dr. Martin Besemer's* "Lodge Band".  In 1882, it is said that he is the leader of the Baptist choir, with sister Charlotte ("Lottie") McWhorter (17 Aug 1882, Ithaca Daily Journal, Ithaca NY, p3, nyshistoricnewspapers.org.), who was also a member of High Bridge Lodge in 1882 (ibid.).

**[Mary Emily "Emily" Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/160363879/mary-emily-mills)**, born Dec 1858 Staten Island NY, died 03 Nov 1937 Brooktondale NY, who commonly went by Emily, and in more formal contexts, M. Emily Mills or M. E. Mills. Emily (and perhaps Jonas) joined the Lodge shortly after arriving in Mott’s Corners, as she "furnished entertainment for the good of the order" in August 1879. (20 Aug 1879, Ithaca Daily Journal, Ithaca NY, p4.) She remained with the lodge until its last meeting, where her name, and position as Secretary are the last words recorded for the Lodge. Emily was the youngest child of Edward Hallock and Mary Ann Mills, and she was the last surviving member of Edward Mills' family. At least by 1892, she lists herself as clerk in her father's store in the NY State Census. Emily took over her father's store after his death and ran it as M.E. Mills until her death. Emily was a member of the Congregational Church and was involved in temperance for many decades, also joining the WCTU.

## The Templars' Organizational Structure

This section seeks to provide the reader with adequate context to understand the Lodge meeting minutes.

High Bridge Lodge was what was known in the Order as a "subordinate lodge". Articles V and VI of the Subordinate Lodge Constitution describes offices, terms and duties necessary to understand the meeting minutes.

<figure>

> The regular terms shall commence with the first meetings in February, May, August and November. The officers shall be elected by ballot and majority vote at the last regular meeting of each term, and installed at the first.

<figcaption>
<cite>

— 1875, Subordinate Lodge Constitution, Article V, Sec. 5, from *A Digest of the Laws, Decisions, Rules and Usages of the Independent Order of Good Templars* by Simeon B. Chase, p40-41. 

</cite>
<figcaption>
</figure>

The following are the offices in the order defined in the Subordinate Lodge Constitution. In practice, the honorific "Worthy" may precede any office title in the meeting minutes, and abbreviations such as W.C. or W.C.T. for the Worthy Chief Templar, were commonly used in the meeting minutes as well as Good Templars publications generally.

<dl>

  1. <dt>Worthy Chief Templar</dt>
     <dd>

     "The W.C.T. shall be the chief executive officer of the Lodge, preside at its meetings, enforce a due observance of the Constitution and Laws..."  (Chase, *Digest*, p41)

     </dd>
  2. <dt>Worthy Vice Templar</dt>
     <dd>

     "The W.V.T shall render the W.C.T such assistance as may be required, perform the duties of that office in his absense, and have charge of the doors and ante-rooms of the Lodge." (Chase, *Digest*, p41)

     </dd>
  3. <dt>Secretary</dt>
     <dd>

     "The Secretary shall keep a fair and impartial record of the proceedings of the Lodge, write communications, fill up certificates, notify of meetings when ordered by the W.C.T., and attest all moneys ordered to be paid at a regular meeting, and no other." (Chase, *Digest*, p41)

     </dd>
  4. <dt>Financial Secretary</dt>
     <dd>
     
     "The F. Secretary shall keep just and true accounts between the Lodge and its members, credit the accounts received, and immeidately pay the same over to the Treasurer, taking a receipt." (Chase, *Digest*, p42)

     </dd>
  5. <dt>Treasurer</dt>
     <dd>

     "The Treasurer...shall pay all order drawn on him by the W.C.T., attested by the Secretary, and no others. He shall receive all moneys of the Lodge, and hold the same until experiation of his term, unless otherwise ordered." (Chase, *Digest*, p42)

     </dd>
  6. <dt>Chaplain</dt>
  7. <dt>Marshal</dt>
     <dd>

     "The Marshal shall have charge of the regalia and all other property of the Lodge, which is not specifically entrusted to other officers, and see that it is kept in proper order... He Shall assist the W.C.T. in preserving order, superintend the balloting, count the votes upon division, introduce candidates,and perform such other duties as may be required by the Ritual or Lodge." (Chase, *Digest*, p43)

     </dd>
  8. <dt>Guard, or "Inside Guard"</dt>
     <dd>

     "The Guard and Sentinel, under direction of the W.V.T., shall have charge fo the doors and the anterooms of the Lodge." (Chase, *Digest*, p43)

     </dd>
  9. <dt>Sentinel, or "Outside Guard"</dt>
     <dd>See #8 immediately above.</dd>
  10. <dt>Assistant Secretary</dt>
      <dd>

      "The A.S. and D.M. shall act under the direction of the S. and M. respecitvely, and perform such other duties as may be required of them." (Chase, *Digest*, p43)

      </dd>
  11. <dt>Deputy Marshal</dt>
      <dd>See #10 immediately above</dd>
  12. <dt>Right Supporter or "Right Hand Supporter"</dt>

</dl>

</figure>

The Secretary, Financial Secretary and Treasurer all had the additional responsibilities of making reports to the Lodge at the end or their (quarterly) terms. 

An additional office was the **P.W.C.T., the Past Worthy Chief Templar**:

<figure>

> The W.C.T of one term shall be, when present, the acting P.W.C.T of the succeeding term. In his absence, the P.W.C.T. next in seniority shall fill that office. He shall have an oversight of the ceremonies, correct errors in the signs and instructions, give the charge to initiates as required by the Ritual, and examine and introduce visitor who apply for admission.

<figcaption>
</figure>

Subordinate lodges also had the title of Lodge Deputy which was an annual position position appointed by the W.C.T. with input from other Lodge members. Although Chase's *Digest* references this position in many of its documented decisions, I cannot seem to find an actual description of the duties of this position in the lodge constitutions. Other guides and commentaries more explicitly describe it. [TODO: add lodge deputy description, responsibilities, contrast with "Deputy Marshall"]

High Bridge Lodge also had two standing committees: the finance and sick committees. [TODO: add prescribed standing committees, responsibilities of sick committee.]

At the county level, there was the County Lodge (a "District Lodge" in the more formal terminology of the Good Templars) which held quarterly meetings that was attended by appointed delegates from High Bridge Lodge. Subordinate lodges reported membership numbers to the County Lodge quarterly, as evidenced by the surviving form for High Bridge Lodge, shown elsewhere in this material. 

At the state level, the Grand Lodge held annual meetings of delegates from subordinate lodges across the state. Officers of the Grand Lodge had the additional honorific "Grand" in their titles, for example, Grand Secretary and Grand Worthy Chief Templar, the highest state officer in the Order. 

Similarly at the national level, The Right Worthy Grand Lodge met annually and was "the source of the true and legitimate Order of Good Templars in North America, and possesses such powers and jurisdiction over the whole Order" (Digest, p11.) Somewhat confusingly, the Right Worthy Grand Lodge is sometimes referred to simply as The Grand Lodge of North America or even just "Grand Lodge" when the context implies the national organization. Titles of officers at the national level begin "Right Worthy Grand..." and the highest officer was the Right Worthy Grand Templar, dropping "Chief".

**"Something or Nothing"** furnished by Emily Mills. Part of the difficulty searching for this, is that the phrase "something for nothing" and similar variations were commonly used in advertisements, and more metaphorically in discussions involving political compromise, for example. The phrase "something or nothing" was more often used in moral and philosophical contexts, for example, relating to principles or customs, that they must mean "something or nothing": in other words, if that something did not apply in the given context, it would not apply in any context. 

In addition to searching directly for the title, I looked up specific authors of the time, especially female authors associated with temperance and suffrage, and I reviewed their works specifically. (See the reference section below for a list of some of their names.) This approach turned up a possible match (if we assume the Lodge secretary Arthur Green didn't perfectly record the title spoken): the poem "Nothing and Something" by Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, first published in 1872, the subject of which is "the victim of drink". 

<figure>

<pre>

NOTHING AND SOMETHING. 

It is nothing to me, the beauty said, 
With a careless toss of her pretty head; 
The man is weak if he can’t refrain 
From the cup you say is fraught with pain. 
It was something to her in after years, 
When her eyes were drenched with burning tears, 
And she watched in lonely grief and dread, 
And startled to hear a staggering tread. 

It is nothing to me, the mother said; 
I have no fear that my boy will tread 
In the downward path of sin and shame, 
And crush my heart and darken his name. 
It was something to her when that only son 
From the path of right was early won, 
And madly cast in the flowing bowl 
A ruined body and sin-wrecked soul. 

It is nothing to me, the young man cried: 
In his eye was a flash of scorn and pride; 
I heed not the dreadful things ye tell: 
I can rule myself I know full well. 
It was something to him when in prison he lay 
The victim of drink, life ebbing away; 
And thought of his wretched child and wife, 
And the mournful wreck of his wasted life. 

It is nothing to me, the merchant said, 
As over his ledger he bent his head; 
I’m busy to-day with tare and tret, 
And I have no time to fume and fret. 
It was something to him when over the wire 
A message came from a funeral pyre— 
A drunken conductor had wrecked a train, 
And his wife and child were among the slain. 

It is nothing to me, the voter said, 
The party’s loss is my greatest dread; 
Then gave his vote for the liquor trade, 
Though hearts were crushed and drunkards made. 
It was something to him in after life, 
When his daughter became a drunkard’s wife 
And her hungry children cried for bread, 
And trembled to hear their father’s tread. 

Is it nothing for us to idly sleep. 
While the cohorts of death their vigils keep? 
To gather the young and thoughtless in, 
And grind in our midst a grist of sin?
It is something, yes, all, for us to stand 
Clasping by faith our Saviour’s hand; 
To learn to labor, live and fight 
On the side of God and changeless light.

<aside>

  - "Frances Ellen Watkins Harper (September 24, 1825 – February 22, 1911) was an American abolitionist, suffragist, poet, temperance activist, teacher, public speaker, and writer. Beginning in 1845, she was one of the first African American women to be published in the United States. Born free in Baltimore, Maryland, Harper had a long and prolific career, publishing her first book of poetry at the age of 20. At 67, she published her widely praised novel Iola Leroy (1892), placing her among the first Black women to publish a novel. As a young woman in 1850, Harper taught domestic science at Union Seminary in Columbus, Ohio, a school affiliated with the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME). In 1851, while living with the family of William Still, a clerk at the Pennsylvania Abolition Society who helped refugee slaves make their way along the Underground Railroad, Harper started to write anti-slavery literature. After joining the American Anti-Slavery Society in 1853, Harper began her career as a public speaker and political activist. Harper also had a successful literary career. Her collection Poems on Miscellaneous Subjects (1854) was a commercial success, making her the most popular African American poet before Paul Laurence Dunbar. Her short story "Two Offers" was published in the Anglo-African in 1859, making literary history as the first short story published by a Black woman. Harper founded, supported, and held high office in several national progressive organizations. In 1886, she became superintendent of the Colored Section of the Philadelphia and Pennsylvania Women's Christian Temperance Union. In 1896 she helped found the National Association of Colored Women and served as its vice president. Harper died at age 85 on February 22, 1911." ([Frances Ellen Watkins Harper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Ellen_Watkins_Harper), Wikipedia.org) 

  - Although I transcribed this from the 1891 edition, multiple sources corroborate that the first edition of *Sketches of Southern Life* containing this poem was published in 1872, suggesting the possibility that Emily Mills was first introduced to the author as a school student in Corfu NY.

John Greenleaf Whittier was a popular contemporary poet and activist, who wrote eloquently on the subjects of Christianity, temperance, abolition and women's suffrage.

<figure>

> John Greenleaf Whittier (December 17, 1807 – September 7, 1892) was an American Quaker poet and advocate of the abolition of slavery in the United States. Frequently listed as one of the fireside poets, he was influenced by the Scottish poet Robert Burns. Whittier is remembered particularly for his anti-slavery writings, as well as his 1866 book *Snow-Bound*.

> The fireside poets – also known as the schoolroom or household poets – were a group of 19th-century American poets associated with New England. These poets were very popular among readers and critics both in the United States and overseas. Their domestic themes and messages of morality presented in conventional poetic forms deeply shaped their era until their decline in popularity at the beginning of the 20th century.
>
> The group is typically thought to include Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, William Cullen Bryant, John Greenleaf Whittier, James Russell Lowell, and Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., who were the first American poets whose popularity rivaled that of British poets, both at home and abroad. Ralph Waldo Emerson is occasionally included in the group as well. The name "fireside poets" is derived from that popularity; their writing was a source of entertainment for families gathered around the fire at home. The name was further inspired by Longfellow's 1850 poetry collection The Seaside and the Fireside. Lowell published a book titled Fireside Travels in 1864 which helped solidify the title.
>
> In an era without radio, television, or Internet, these poets were able to garner a general public popularity that has no equivalent in the 21st century. Their influence was furthered by their long lives, as well as their other high-profile activities, including serving as professors and academic chairs, editing popular newspapers, serving as foreign diplomats, giving popular speeches, and translating works by Dante and Homer.

The poem recorded as "**The Call of St. Gregory**", furnished by Emily Mills, is certainly "The Supper of St. Gregory" by John Greenleaf Whittier, first published a few months prior in Dec 1883, Harper's New Monthly Magazine, v68, p16-18. The same poem would later be renamed "Saint Gregory's Guest" when republished in Whittier's 1886 anthology of the same name, and this is the poem's cited title thereafter. (Notice that "Saint" is abbreviated in the first title and not the second.)

> Pope Gregory I (Latin: Gregorius I; c. 540 – 12 March 604), commonly known as Saint Gregory the Great, was the 64th Bishop of Rome from 3 September 590 to his death. He is known for instituting the first recorded large-scale mission from Rome, the Gregorian mission, to convert the then largely pagan Anglo-Saxons to Christianity. Gregory is also well known for his writings, which were more prolific than those of any of his predecessors as pope. The epithet Saint Gregory the Dialogist has been attached to him in Eastern Christianity because of his Dialogues. English translations of Eastern texts sometimes list him as Gregory "Dialogos" from the Greek διάλογος (dialogos, conversation), or the Anglo-Latinate equivalent "Dialogus".
>
> Throughout the Middle Ages, he was known as "the Father of Christian Worship" because of his exceptional efforts in revising the Roman worship of his day. His contributions to the development of the Divine Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts, still in use in the Byzantine Rite, were so significant that he is generally recognized as its de facto author.
>
> Gregory is one of the Latin Fathers and a Doctor of the Church. He is considered a saint in the Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, Anglican Communion, various Lutheran denominations, and other Protestant denominations. Immediately after his death, Gregory was canonized by popular acclaim. The Protestant reformer John Calvin admired Gregory greatly and declared in his Institutes that Gregory was the last good pope. He is the patron saint of musicians, singers, students, and teachers.

In the poem, a poor monk named Gregory is visited in his "narrow cell" by an unknown beggar, and the monk gives him his sole possession, a silver cup left him by his mother. Years later, Gregory became Pope, and he prepared a beggar's feast attended by an uninvited and unknown guest. Despite this, Pope Gregory welcomed this guest "for the sake of Him who is they Lord and mine". The guest then revealed himself as Christ "The Wonderful" and returned to Gregory "thy gift of old", his mother's silver cup.

THE SUPPER OF ST. GREGORY. 

A TALE for Roman guides to tell 
To careless, sight-worn travellers still, 
Who pause beside the narrow cell 
Of Gregory on the Caelian Hill, 

One day before the monk’s door came 
A beggar, stretching empty palms, 
Fainting and fast-sick, in the name 
Of the Most Holy asking alms. 

And the monk answered; “All I have 
In this poor cell of mine I give, 
The silver cup my mother gave; 
In Christ’s name take thou it, and live.” 

Years passed; and, called at last to bear 
The pastoral crook and keys of Rome, 
The poor monk, in St. Peter’s chair, 
Sat the crowned lord of Christendom. 

“Prepare a feast.” St. Gregory cried, 
“And let twelve beggars sit thereat.” 
The beggars came, and one beside, 
An unknown stranger, with them sat. 

"I asked thee not.” the Pontiff spake, 
“O stranger; but if need be thine, 
I bid thee welcome, for the sake 
Of Him who is thy Lord and mine.” 

A grave, calm face the stranger raised, 
Like His who on Gennesaret trod, 
Or His on whom the Chaldeans gazed, 
Whose form was as the Son of God. 

“Know’st thou,” he said. “thy gift of old?” 
And in the hand he lifted up 
The Pontiff marvelled to behold 
Once more his mother’s silver cup. 

“Thy prayers and alms have risen and bloom 
Sweetly among the flowers of heaven. 
I am The Wonderful, through whom 
Whate’er thou askest shall be given.” 

He spake and vanished. Gregory fell 
With his twelve guests in mute accord 
Prone on their faces, knowing well 
Their eyes of flesh had seen the Lord. 

The old-time legend is not vain; 
Nor vain thy art, Verona’s Paul, 
Telling it o’er and o’er again 
On gray Vicenza’s frescoed wall. 

Still wheresoever pity shares 
Its bread with sorrow, want, and sin, 
And love the beggar’s feast prepares, 
The uninvited Guest comes in. 

Unheard, because our ears are dull. 
Unseen, because our eyes are dim. 
He walks our earth, The Wonderful, 
And all good deeds are done to Him.

  - "The **Chair of Saint Peter** (Latin: Cathedra Petri), also known as the Throne of Saint Peter, is a relic conserved in St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City, the sovereign enclave of the Pope inside Rome, Italy. The relic is a wooden throne that tradition claims belonged to the Apostle Saint Peter, the leader of the Early Christians in Rome and first Pope, and which he used as Bishop of Rome. The relic is enclosed in a sculpted gilt bronze casing designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini and constructed between 1647 and 1653. In 2012, Pope Benedict XVI described the chair as "a symbol of the special mission of Peter and his Successors to tend Christ's flock, keeping it united in faith and in charity." The wooden throne was a gift from Emperor of the Romans Charles the Bald to Pope John VIII in 875. It has been studied many times over the years, most recently between 1968 and 1974, when it was last removed from the Bernini altar. The study concluded that it was not a double, but a single chair, with a covering, and that the oldest parts are from the 6th century. The Chair of Saint Peter is the second altar within the church with the first one being the one under the baldacchino. It stands to remind visitors of the Catholic Church's authority." ([Chair of Saint Peter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_Saint_Peter), Wikipedia.org. Emphasis added.)

  - After performing the miracle of walking on water, Jesus sailed to the land of **Gennesaret** where the sick that touched his cloak were healed. "And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore. And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him, And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was. And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole." (Mark 6:53-56, King James Version.) "And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret. And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;  And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole." (Matthew 14:34-36, King James Version.)

  - "And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him. Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the **Chaldeans**, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king. And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream. Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation. The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill. But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof. They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it. The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me. But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof. The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.  And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh. For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon." (Daniel 2:1-12, King James Version. Emphasis added.)

  - "Chaldea(/kælˈdiːə/) was a small country that existed between the late 10th or early 9th and mid-6th centuries BC, after which the country and its people were absorbed and assimilated into the indigenous population of Babylonia. Semitic-speaking, it was located in the marshy land of the far southeastern corner of Mesopotamia and briefly came to rule Babylon. The Hebrew Bible uses the term כשדים (Kaśdim) and this is translated as Chaldaeans in the Greek Old Testament, although there is some dispute as to whether Kasdim in fact means Chaldean or refers to the south Mesopotamian Kaldu. ...The Persians considered this Chaldean societal class to be masters of reading and writing, and especially versed in all forms of incantation, sorcery, witchcraft, and the magical arts. They spoke of astrologists and astronomers as Chaldeans, and it is used with this specific meaning in the Book of Daniel (Dan. i. 4, ii. 2 et seq.) and by classical writers, such as Strabo. ...The term Chaldean was still in use at the time of Cicero (106–43 BC) long after the Chaldeans had disappeared. In one of his speeches he mentioned "Chaldean astrologers", and he spoke of them more than once in his De Divinatione. Other classical Latin writers who speak of them as distinguished for their knowledge of astronomy and astrology are Pliny the Elder, Valerius Maximus, Aulus Gellius, Cato the Elder, Lucretius, and Juvenal. Horace in his Carpe diem ode speaks of the "Babylonian calculations" (Babylonii numeri), the horoscopes of astrologers consulted regarding the future." ([Chaldea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaldea), Wikipedia.org.) The Babylonian Empire was located in the areas presently called Iraq and Syria.

  - "**Verona's Paul**" appears to be a reference to Paolo Veronese, an Italian Renaissance artist who painted *The Supper of Saint Gregory the Great*, a large canvas housed in a convent adjacent to the Basilica Sanctuary of Saint Mary of Monte Berico, a Roman Catholic basilica in Vicenza, northern Italy. Therefore, I believe it is this work that may be referenced in the poem as "**Vicenza's frescoed wall**". "Paolo Caliari (1528 – 19 April 1588), known as Paolo Veronese, was an Italian Renaissance painter based in Venice, known for extremely large history paintings of religion and mythology, such as The Wedding at Cana (1563) and The Feast in the House of Levi (1573). ...His most famous works are elaborate narrative cycles, executed in a dramatic and colorful style, full of majestic architectural settings and glittering pageantry. His large paintings of biblical feasts, crowded with figures, painted for the refectories of monasteries in Venice and Verona are especially famous, and he was also the leading Venetian painter of ceilings." ([Paolo Veronese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_Veronese), Wikipedia.org.) Compare the description of Paolo's "elaborate narrative cycles" to the poem's description of the telling of the legend of The Supper of St. Gregory "**o'er and o'er again on gray Vicenza's frescoed wall**".

"The Supper of St. Gregory" is a very appropriate selection: it reflects the Templar's emphasis on charity (as in their motto: "Faith, Hope, and Charity") as well as their respect and kindness toward all people as made in the image of God: "wheresoever pity shares its bread with sorrow, want and sin...all good deeds are done to Him".

Henry Krum was Caroline Town Supervisor in 1851. "H.S. Krum slipped on an icy pavement in Ithaca last Thursday and broke the small bone in his ankle. Dr. Gallagher reduced the fracture and he is as comfortable as can be under the circumstances." (02 Feb 1889, "Slaterville", Ithaca Daily Journal, Ithaca NY, p3, q23.) Dr. Gallagher was also a Good Templar and is described further below among the list of members.

**Strive, Wait, and Pray** by Adelaide A. Procter, furnished by Emily Mills.

<figure>

<pre>

STRIVE, WAIT, AND PRAY. 

Strive; yet I do not promise 
The prize you dream of to-day 
Will not fade when you think to grasp it, 
And melt in your hand away; 
But another and holier treasure, 
You would now perchance disdain,
I Will come when your toil is over, 
And pay you for all your pain, 

Wait; yet I do not tell you 
The hour you long for now 
Will not come with its radiance vanished, 
And a shadow upon its brow; 
Yet far through the misty future, 
With a crown of starry light, 
An hour of joy you know not 
Is winging her silent flight. 

Pray; though the gift you ask for 
May never comfort your fears, 
May never repay your pleading, 
Yet pray, and with hopeful tears; 
An answer, not that you long for, 
But diviner, will come one day; 
Your eyes are too dim to see it, 
Yet strive, and wait, and pray. 

</pre>

## The Later Members

Aside from accounting for the presence of the currently elected officers, the meeting minutes did not attempt to provide a complete list of members attending each meeting. Names were noted only in relation to initiations, proposals and motions made, nomination and election of officers and their subsequent attendance, and participation in the Good of the Order. And it is clearly evident from reviewing them that the same subgroups of people tended to routinely hold officer positions and provide items for the Good of the Order, suggesting not only that members in good standing may have had imperfect attendance, but that there were likely  "silent" attendees at meetings, and perhaps Jonas Mills was an example of one of these.

It is also interesting to note that a number of members apparently left and returned, as people like Fred Allen and Arnold Hill are proposed and initiated more than once in the meeting minutes. And recall from the main section on [Temperance]({{% relref "temperance" %}}), that George Richardson was a member of the Good Templars several years before his (re)initiation noted in the meeting minutes above.


### Allen

For **Emma L. (Allen) Richardson**, see "Richardson" below. 

**Fred E. Allen** is simply listed as a "laborer" in the 1880 U.S. Census. In the 1920 U.S. Federal Census, Fred appears to be working at Brookton Depot and is a boarder at the home of Clarence and Emma (English) Wheeler, across the street from Mills' Home where **Emily Mills** and Ellen Gould were living at the time.

**Will E. "Willie" Allen**, the younger brother of Fred E. Allen, also listed as a "laborer" in the 1880 U.S. Federal Census.

### Auchoomdy

**Edwin "Ed" and "Eddie" Auchmoody** (1867? to 08 Jan 1885) and **[Flora (Auchmoody) Johnson)](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/83627520/flora-johnsona)** (1864, Ithaca NY to 20 Dec 1939, Monrovia CA) are siblings. Ed died during the time of span of the meeting minutes.

"Miss Flora Auchmoody, who spent the winter in Auburn, has returned and is now with Mrs. Hurlburt." (26 Feb 1889, Ithaca Daily Journal, Ithaca NY, p3)

### Ault

**[George W. Ault](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/99698794/george-w-ault)** (1864 to 1899) and **[Myrtle L. "Myrtie" (Ault) Norwood](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100181319/myrtle-a-norwood)** (1868 to 1936) are siblings.

George appears to have worked in the Vandemark Woolen Mill as a "spinner" in 1892 NY State Census, and brother Freeman Ault is "wool carder" The same census lists Myrtie directly below George with the occupation "teacher".

Myrtie married [Jesse A. Norwood](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/182714572/jesse-a-norwood) (1867 to 22 Mar 1953) in Maywood NE. 30 Aug 1894. 

1872-1904, Marriage Records, State Library and Archives, Nebraska State Historical Society, Lincoln NE, ancestry.com 

"Mr. Will Norwood, formerly with Treman, King & Co., Now engaged in real estate at Maywood, Neb., is visiting his Ithaca friends." (02 Feb 1889, Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p3). and elsewhere on the same page,  under the Slaterville column: "Will Norwood of Nebraska is spending a few weeks at his old home here." (Ibid, q21).

(Is Will Norwood "Brother Norwood" from Slaterville that visited High Bridge Lodge on 22 Feb 1884? Major Northwood in Slaterville.)

Jesse, born in Caroline, "at one time operated a restaurant on East Hill. For the past 48 years he has been a fruit grower in Ithaca." (08 Jun 1953, Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p9.) By 1900, they returned to Ithaca, and by 1910, Jesse was operating the East Hill restaurant. 

The couple appears to separate sometime between the 1910 Federal Census and the 1914, when the Ithaca City Directory lists her by herself, indicating she is a widow. The exact nature and circumstances of the separation are unclear to me, but Myrtie kept her married name the rest of her life and often identified herself as a widow, and it appears she lived and worked as a house keeper in various boarding houses.

Myrtie was still living in Ithaca in the 1925 NY State Census, but a few years later, she is listed in the 1927 Fort Myers FL City Directory (p232), and in the 1930 Federal Census for Fort Myers FL, she was also listed as a widow. 

Interestingly, the 1930 Federal Census lists Jesse Norwood living in Precinct 71, Miami-Dade County FL, his status was divorced, he was working as a fruit grove laborer. In 1940, Jesse was still in Dade County, indicating in the Federal Census that he was widowed, and a citrus grove superintendent. He indicates that his highest grade of school completed was eighth.

**Charles Arthur "Arthur" Denman** is explored among the earlier members above.

In the 15 Jun 1883 meeting, C.A. Denman proposed Miss Ida Olney as a new member of High Bridge Lodge. "Sis Olney" attended her last Lodge meeting on 28 Dec 1883. Arthur and Ida did not attend Lodge the following week on 04 Jan 1884 and married 09 Jan.

Although **George Townley Sanders** and his family were members in the earlier years of the Lodge, the 1880 United States Federal Census for Cortland NY shows that George T. and wife Maria were living in 
Cortland with daughter Sarah and her husband Nelson Edwards, and they remained in Cortland the rest of their lives. Edward Mills had taken over operation of the store. Therefore, references to "George Sanders" and wife in the later years must be George Townley's son, **[George *E.* Sanders](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338797/george-e-sanders)** (16 Aug 1847 to 01 Nov 1889) and his wife **[Fannie (Webster) Sanders](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338798/fannie-sanders)** (23 Nov 1847 to 10 Feb 1896).

### Shurter:

**[Professor Edwin DuBois "E. D." Shurter](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/99602781/mary_catherine_shurter)**, (24 Oct 1863 to 13 Oct 1946) was born and raised in Mott's Corners, and became a lawyer in Ithaca early in his career before entering academia, eventually becoming the Chair of Oratory at the University of Texas, Austin, and authoring a number of respected books on the subject over several decades. The professor and his wife [Alice (Burtt) Shurter](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100332796/alice_shurter) (26 Dec 1870 to 10 Apr 1951) lived in Austin TX for a number of years, visiting Brookton periodically before finally returning to the hamlet. 

Cornell University library owns several of Edwin and Alice's scrapbooks that cover the time of their courtship through their years in Austin, and documenting their travels. The organization of the books suggests this was a hobby that both independently engaged in prior to their marriage, and then continued together. The scrapbooks include photographs, and the context suggests to me that photography may have been primarily Alice's interest. There are a number of fascinating items in the scrapbooks, including a small sealed envelope containing the Professor's shaved mustache hairs, which Alice documented amusingly.

A partial bibliography of the Professor's publications:

  - 1903, *Public Speaking: A Treatise on Delivery with Selections for Declaiming* by Edwin DuBois Shurter, Allyn and Bacon, Boston MA.

  - 1906, *Masterpieces of Modern Oratory* edited by Edwin DuBois Shurter, Ginn & Company, Boston MA. 

  - 1908, *Extempore Speaking for School and College* by Edwin DuBois Shurter, Ginn & Company, Boston MA.

  - 1909, *Representative College Orations* by Edwin DuBois Shurter, The Macmillan Company, New York NY.

  - 1912, *The Rhetoric of Oratory* by Edwin DuBois Shurter, The Macmillan Company, New York NY.

  - 1913, *School Literary Societies: Model Constitution, Rules of Parliamentary Procedure, and Principles of Debating* by Edwin DuBois Shurter, University of Texas, Austin TX. 

  - 1917, *How to Debate* by Edwin DuBois Shurter, Harper & Brother, New York NY.

Cornell University library owns a copy of 1903's *Public Speaking* signed by the author. The book was a gift to his mother-in-law, and presumably returned to Brookton after her death, eventually finding its way to local collector Bob Albertson, who then gifted it to Cornell. 

{{% fig "temperance/good-templars/members/ed-shurter-bob-albertson" "800" /%}}

E. D. Shurter also wrote "In Tribute to Emily Mills" in the Ithaca Journal after she died. 

The Professor's middle name is alternately spelled "Dubois" and "Du Bois" among other typographical variations.

**[Jane (Shutt) Shurter](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100594934/jane-shurter)** (21 Nov 1825 to 23 Jun 1897) was the widow of [Josiah Shurter](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100594864/josiah-shurter) (26 Apr 1815 to 05 Aug 1877), a former owner of the Mills' Store property and lower grist mill, and the grandfather of Jessie Brewer, who was born four years after Josiah died. Josiah was a "worthy brother" in the Mott's Corners Division of the Sons of Temperance at the time of his death. Jane joined the Good Templars shortly after his death.

"Miss May Tobey, of Brookton, Comes here on Wednesday of each week to give lessons in music and painting." (05 Jun 1884, "Tobeytown", The Daily Democrat, Ithaca NY, p4, q33, fultonhistory.org).

May Tobey was baptized, along with Emily Mills and 13 other people, by Reverend Annis Ford Eastman on 07 Apr 1907. 

See also May Tobey's sister **Ellen S. (Tobey) Lounsbery** above under Lounsbery. At the time of these meetings, Ellen was the widow of Richard Lounsbery, one of Edward Lounsbery's brothers. May Tobey and her brother-in-law Richard Lounsbery performed music together on multiple occasions.

"Slaterville Springs, Jan. 15.–Mrs. Clara Tobey, who has been caring for her sister-in-law, Miss May Tobey, at the City Hospital in Ithaca for several weeks, is with her daughter, Mrs. A. F. Head, for a few days of much needed rest. Miss Tobey’s condition does not improve." (15 Jan 1915, Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p11, newspapers.com.)

### Wolcott

**[William Benton Wolcott](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100303590/william-benton-wolcott)** (06 Oct 1832 to 25 Feb 1911), was a Civil War Veteran in Company K of the 137th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment under the command of Colonel David Ireland, whose name was later honored by the Brookton post of the GAR. William participated in the battles of Resaca, Chancellorsville and Gettysburg, as was well as the sieges of Altanta and Savanna, among many other battles and campaigns. His regiment "helped raise the Stars and Stripes over Atlanta".

William married [Ellen A. (Shurter) Wolcott Aldrich](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/187990128/ellen-a-aldrich_wolcott) (07 Sep 1843 to 21 Apr 1928), in 30 Aug 1862, just weeks before William mustered in at Binghamton NY on 25 Sep 1862. Immediately after mustering out on 09 Jun 1865, William and Ellen are recorded in the NY census living with Ellen's father Josiah Shurter at The Shurter House. 

A few years later, William Wolcott becomes the first owner of 475 Brooktondale Road when it was first subdivided from the lower grist mill owned by Jacob Vandemark and Charles W. Personius. The property at this time was known as "The Wolcott Lot". William Wolcott at various times in the census records gave his occupation as carpenter, wagon maker, and carriage maker. Given his occupation, I speculate that he was the primary builder of the original structure at 475, that survives today as I write these words within its walls. William's father-in-law Josiah Shurter also describes himself as both a "wagon maker" and a "carriage maker", and it seems reasonable to assume that both men worked in "The Brewer Barn" that was known at one time as "Willis Shurter's Wagon Shop in Motts Corners". Willis Shurter inherited his father Josiah Shurter’s businesses, and Willis Shurter was Jesse (Shurter) Brewer’s father.

### Woodhull:

**[Catharine F. "Cassie" (Woodhull) Landon](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/67294683/catharine-f-landon)** (Apr 1870 to 1944) married [Esty J. Landon](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/67294429/esty-j-landon) (Jun 1871 to 06 Dec 1906). 

Esty's father is [Bennett T. Landon](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/63631620/bennett-t-landon) (05 Oct 1829 to 1904) of Danby, and Bennett is the brother of [Sextus Barnes "S.B." Landon](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/63631163/sextus-barnes-landon) (20 Apr 1834 to 24 May 1925), who was a [founding member of the Congregational Church of Mott's Corners]({{% relref "founding-documents" %}}).

Another brother of Bennett and S.B. Landon is [Paul H. Landon](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/63648076/paul-h-landon) (08 Apr 1836 to 01 Jun 1862) who is the father of [Elosia P. (Landon) Wool](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/93122794/elosia-p-wool) (17 Oct 1860 to 07 May 1934), one of the members of the Slaterville Logde, who visited High Bridge Lodge on 22 Feb 1884. In other words, Elosia and Esty were first cousins.

## After 27 Aug 1886

The weight of circumstantial evidence also favors the simplest explanation for the abrupt ending of the meeting minutes notebook: it appears that 27 Aug 1886 was indeed the last meeting of High Bridge Lodge #296.

Emily Mills was secretary at that time, and several items that accompany the meeting minutes notebook either bear her signature and other handwriting that is clearly her distinctive style, or are otherwise items appropriate for the secretary to possess. It is also interesting to note that some of the items appear to be forms that were filled out by Emily months before the last meeting and yet appear to have not been sent out. A few items also show that mail was still coming to the Lodge after the last meeting.

{{% fig "temperance/good-templars/Lounsbery-Edward-certificate1" "800" /%}}

The year on the form above appears to be 1885, despite the outdated reference to "Mott's Corners"; The state organization may have simply had the older name still on their records.

I think its very unlikely that Emily would have left the lodge before its demise, and if she had, she presumably would have surrendered these items to the Lodge, as was her responsibility:

<figure>

> [The Secretary] shall perform such duties as may be required of him by the lodge, or his charge, and deliver up to his successor, within one week from the expiration of his term, all books, papers, and other property in his possession, belonging to his office.

Although the Ithaca Union Lodge appeared to be active well into the early 1900's, many lodges that were considered very strong, such as those in Danby, Freeville, Mclean, and Brookton all eventually became inactive and years later, newspaper accounts tell of the local citizens trying to form new lodges of the Good Templars in some of these places, as was the case in Brookton:

{{% fig "temperance/1890-01-The-Official-Organ-Syracuse-NY-v9-n3-p719" "500" /%}}

Edward's persistence was rewarded when High Bridge Lodge was re-instituted by Mar 1890. By Good Templars policy, re-instituted Lodges within the state had to be assigned a new number, and so High Bridge Lodge No. 720 began. This Lodge met on Wednesdays, presumably returning to Lounsbery Hall. I presently know nothing of their membership.

{{% fig "temperance/1890-03-The-Official-Organ-Syracuse-NY-v9-n5-p761" "500" /%}}

{{% fig "temperance/1890-09-The-Official-Organ-Syracuse-NY-v9-n11-p3" "500" /%}}

As the 30 Apr 1886 quarterly return shown previously attests, High Bridge No. 296 did not have a "Juvenile Temple connected with the Lodge". However, High Bridge No. 720 did have a Juvenile Temple, called "Perseverance" No. 323.

{{% fig "temperance/1890-10-The-Official-Organ-Syracuse-NY-v10-n1-p866" "500" /%}}

{{% fig "temperance/1891-01-22-The-Journal-Ithaca-NY" "500" /%}}

By Jun 1891, High Bridge Lodge No. 720 "suspended", although Perseverance Temple was apparently still true to its name for some time thereafter. The Official Organ did not remove Lodge 720 from their Jan 1892 list of lodges in Tompkins County, but that is the last printed mention of the Good Templars in Brookton I have yet found.

As will be seen, a lodge described as being in a "very flourishing condition" was a common refrain used over the years and in many locations of the Good Templars, whose members were encouraged to advertise their lodges, such as with regular newspaper updates.

The IOGT named themselves after the Knights Templar, citing the legend that the original knights "drank sour milk, and also because they were fighting 'a great crusade' against 'this terrible vice' of alcohol."

## Passwords

The Good Templars based their organizational structures and rituals on the model of Freemasonry, including a strict code a secrecy that included the use of passwords.

Updated passwords were issued from Grand Lodges to subordinate lodges like High Bridge, on a quarterly basis. This arrangement served an important practical purpose, as its timing coincided with the payment of dues and was intended to encourage subordinate lodges to be prompt in their payments. Article 4, section 2 of the Constitution of Subordinate Lodges states "no member shall receive the Pass-Word until his dues for the current quarter are paid, and no member without the Pass-Word shall be permitted to sit in the Lodge." (Digest p39-40)



Examples:

  - "Lord save us or we perish" (T&R, p78)

  - 




"The young--that we may save them from falling into the snares of the tempter" (Digest, p28)

According to the Constitution of Subordinate Lodges (High Bridge would be considered a subordinate lodge underneath the Grand Lodge), "No person under twelve years of age shall be admitted a member of this [subordinate] Lodge" (Digest, p38)


"Juvenile Temples" for the youngest members and for older children, "Junior Lodges". "In the Juvenile Temple the children are also taught to abstain from the use of tobacco, as well as to refrain from the practice of gambling and the use of profane language." (Turnbull, p9)



"There are two essential qualifications for membership in the Order: (1) belief in the existence of Almighty God; and (2) willingness to take the Good Templar's life-long pledge.




"20. The P.W. is not be be given unless the member is clear of the books, and to be clear of the books at the commencement of a quarter, one quarter's dues must be paid in advance. -- Iowa, 13, Cal., 8th s., 43. 21. And fines as well as dues. --Ill., 1858." (Digest, p244)

I decided to take another run at figuring out the "credit system contest", and by piecing together small details from a number of different newspaper articles from around the country, I think I have a rough outline of what this was. Thankfully the Good Templars were so aggressive in promoting themselves in the papers!

It seems the contest was typically organized into two teams sometimes referred to as “companies”, “divisions” or simply “sides”. Each side has a captain, , and each team had a captain. In at least one case, the teams were divided by gender, but this seems unlikely to be the norm and was not the case with the High Bridge Lodge contest in 1883. 

Teams earned credits for participating in various temperance related activities, and the context suggests that different activities had different credit scores: on the lower end of the scoring spectrum were activities such as attending weekly lodge meetings, as attested to in the recorded "roll call" done during the contest at High Bridge Lodge. On the higher end, it appears that the most valued activity was recruiting new members.

The "credit systems" advertised in The Official Organ would have included rules for earning credits and forms for tracking credits earned.

At the end of the contest, the losing team furnished "a reward of merit" to the winning team, and this typically involved furnishing a dinner. 

Edward Lounsbery and likely Richard Denman, although Arthur and Charles Hill, are credited with the idea of the credit system contest.      

"Intermission, during which Bro Denman's side furnished ice cream for the company as a reward of merit for the Credit contest." (15 Jun 1883, Meeting Minutes, High Bridge Lodge No. 296, Brookton NY. ) 

The idea of the credit system contest may have originated (or at least been formalized) by the Good Templars and spread to other organizations. The vast majority of the newspaper reporting on these contests were of the Good Templars. I did find several references to what seemed to be similar credit system contests associated with the Grange, and even one associated with a church Sunday school (31 Jan 1918, Morning Press, Santa Barbrar CA, p5, q21, newspapers.com), suggesting to me the possibility that the idea originated with the Good Templars and entered these other organizations through either current, or perhaps more likely, former Good Templars members. 

It would be natural for Good Templars to also be members of the Grange as well as active in their local churches. There were many parallels between the Good Templars and the Grange. They were both secret fraternal orders heavily influenced by the rituals of the Freemasons, the Good Templars organized before the Civil War and the Grange after, . I have found credit system contests mentioned into the 1930's, and most of the Grange references were in the 20th century and seem to coincide with a decline of mentions of such contests among the Good Templars during the same time.

> At a meeting of Banner Lodge, of Good Templars of Southhold, held last Thursday evening, two new members were admitted, William Wooden and Arnold Danz. The judges in the credit system contest, William M. Wood, Mrs. Jessie Wells and E. Ernest Boissian, announced that Company B, Capt. Benjamin S. Conklin, was the winning side, having a majority of two hundred and thirty-two credits. The losing side is to purchase a fine new chair for the use of the Chief Templar. The credit system has proven of great benefit to the lodge. New members have been added, interesting programmes have been given each meeting night, and great interest has been manifested by all of the members.

(Recorder, Catskill NY, q13, fultonhistory.com.)

"A Treat to Strawberries. During the winter past, Mrs. R.M. Billings and Mrs. C.L. Grippen led opposing forces in a credit system contest in the local lodge of Good Templars, and in this contest, Mrs. Billings' party was worsted, by only 16b points, however. According to agreement the beaten party is to furnish a supper–a treat for the lodge. Pursuant to this agreement the supper will be served next Wednesday evening, June 15, at the old school house on Main Street. As we intimated previously this supper will be free–that is free to Good Templars. The intention is to have a grand banquet, strawberries, with all the accessories and et ceteras, lemonade, and cold water, we suppose, and if they succeed in eating up all the victuals which we have been informed will be provided, there’ll be no need of more eating for some time to come."

> When the Grange first began in 1867, it borrowed some of its rituals and symbols from Freemasonry, including oaths, secret meetings, and special passwords necessary to keep railroad spies out of their meetings. It also copied ideas from Greek, Roman and Biblical mythology. Small, ceremonial farm tools are often displayed at Grange meetings. Elected officers are in charge of opening and closing each meeting. There are seven degrees of Grange membership; the ceremony of each degree relates to the seasons and various symbols and principles. During the last few decades, the Grange has moved toward public meetings and no longer meets in secret. Though the secret meetings do not occur, the Grange still acknowledges its rich history and practices some traditions.

(The most fundamental requirement of membership in the Templars was a belief in God, and with the possible exception of Lodges that had formed in India, this was the Christian God. Consider that W. T. Graham, a member at one time of High Bridge Lodge was also associated with the Sunday School of Brookton Congregational Church.)
