      Sel Sis Olney "The book of life" Sister Johnson, Auchmoody, Davenport and Bro Ault were not prepared.

      By this time Bro A Denman had decided to experiement on us with his solemn article The title sounded like "free mind", there were one or two hindrances before he was fairly started which added to the interest, it was as solemn and awful as we had been led to expect. Many of the members were quite hysterical at the close of it.

      The Officers & Members of High Bridge Lodge met together, not to pursue the usual order of business, but to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Lodge. It having been the custom in the past to have an annual supper, it was decided to hold it this year as usual nowithstanding the low condition of the Order. 

      Accordingly thirteen members presented themselves at the Lodge room each bearing some dainty with which to spread the festal board.

      Through the kindess of Sister Hungerford each person was supplied with a cup of delicious coffee smoking hot.

      After every one had eaten enough to satisfy the cravings of hunger and the table had been cleared, Sister Toby entertained the members with some music after which the company separated feeling that the evening had been most pleasantly spent.
